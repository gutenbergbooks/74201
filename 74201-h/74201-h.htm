<p><span class="smcap large">When</span> I married Mr. Loudon, it is scarcely
possible to imagine any person more completely
ignorant than I was, of every thing
relating to plants and gardening; and, as may
be easily imagined, I found every one about
me so well acquainted with the subject,
that I was soon heartily ashamed of my ignorance.
My husband, of course, was quite
as anxious to teach me as I was to learn, and
it is the result of his instructions, that I now
(after ten years experience of their efficacy)
wish to make public for the benefit of
others.</p>

<p>I do this, because I think books intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
for professional gardeners, are seldom suitable
to the wants of amateurs. It is so very
difficult for a person who has been acquainted
with a subject all his life, to
imagine the state of ignorance in which a
person is who knows nothing of it, that
adepts often find it impossible to communicate
the knowledge they possess.
Thus, though it may at first sight appear
presumptuous in me to attempt to teach
an art of which for three fourths of my
life I was perfectly ignorant, it is in fact
that very circumstance which is one of my
chief qualifications for the task. Having
been a full-grown pupil myself, I know
the wants of others in a similar situation;
and having never been satisfied without
knowing the reason for every thing I was
told to do, I am able to impart these reasons
to others. Thus my readers will be able to
judge for themselves, and to adapt their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
practice to the circumstances in which they
may be placed.</p>

<p>Such is the nature and purport of the
present work, and I have only to add that
I have spared no pains to render it as
perfect as I could make it. The engravings
have been made here from drawings of
specimens previously prepared, and I can
therefore vouch for their accuracy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="c less">STIRRING THE SOIL.</p>


<p><i>Digging.</i>—Every one knows that the first
operation of the gardener, whether a new
garden is to be made, or merely an old one
re-planted, is to dig the ground; though but
comparatively few persons are aware why this
is so essentially necessary to be done. When
a piece of rough ground is to be taken into
cultivation, and a garden made where there
was none before, the use of digging is obvious
enough; as the ground requires to be levelled,
and divided by walks, and thrown up
into beds, to give it the shape and appearance
of a garden, which could not be done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
without stirring the soil: but why the beds
in an old garden should be always dug or
forked over, before they are re-planted, is
quite another question, and one that it requires
some consideration to answer.</p>

<p>When any soil, except sand or loose gravel,
remains unstirred for any length of time,
it becomes hard, and its particles adhere so
firmly together as not to be separated without
manual force. It is quite clear that when
soil is in this state, it is unfit for the reception
of seeds; as the tender roots of the
young plants will not be able to penetrate it
through without great difficulty, and neither
air nor water can reach them in sufficient
quantities to make them thrive. When a
seed is put into the ground, it is the warmth
and moisture by which it is surrounded that
make it vegetate. It first swells, and the
skin with which it is covered cracks and peels
off; then two shoots issue from the vital
knot, (a point easily discoverable in large
seeds,) one of which descends and is called
the root, while the other ascends to form
the leaves, stem, flowers, and fruit.</p>

<p>This is what is meant by the germination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of the seed, and this may be effected by the
aid of heat and moisture alone, as is done
with mustard and cress, when raised on wet
flannel in a saucer. But plants raised in this
manner cannot be of long duration; as,
though they will live for a short time on the
albumen contained in the seed, on which
they feed, as the chicken does on the nourishment
contained in the egg, this is soon
exhausted, and the plant will die if not supplied
with fresh food, which it can only obtain
by means of the root. Thus, the root
is necessary, not only to form a base to support
the plant and to keep it upright, but to
supply it with food; and nature has given it a
tendency to bury itself in the ground, not
only to enable the plant to take a firm hold
of the soil, but to preserve the root in a fitting
state for absorbing food, which it can
only do when it is kept warm, moist, and secluded
from the light.</p>

<p>The manner in which the root is fitted
for the purposes for which it was designed,
affords an admirable illustration of the care
and wisdom displayed by the Great Creator
in all his works. In nature nothing is superfluous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and yet everything has been provided
for. It has been already observed, that the
two principal uses of the root are to give the
plant a firm hold of the ground, and to supply
it with food. For the first purpose the root
either spreads so widely through the surface
soil as to form a sufficient base for the height
of the plant, or it descends a sufficient depth
into the earth to steady the part above
ground; and in either case the growth of
the plant is wisely and wonderfully proportioned
to the strength of the support which
the root affords it. For the second purpose,
that of supplying the plant with nourishment,
the root divides at the extremity
of each shoot into numerous fibres or fibrils,
each furnished at its extremity with a spongiole
or spongy substance, which affords the
only means the plant possesses of absorbing
the moisture necessary for its support. It is
thus quite clear, that every thing that tends
to nourish and increase the growth of the
root, must contribute to the health and vigour
of the rest of the plant; and that no plant
can thrive, the root of which is cramped in
its growth, or weakened for want of nourishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
This being allowed, it is evident that
the first step towards promoting the growth
of any plant is to provide a fitting receptacle
for the root; and this is done by pulverizing
the ground in which the seed is to
be sown so as to render it in a fit state for
the roots to penetrate it easily. Thus they
will neither be checked in their growth for
want of room, nor be obliged to waste their
strength in overcoming unnecessary obstacles;
such as twining themselves round a
stone, or trying to force their way through
a hard clod of earth. The second point of
affording the root abundance of nourishment
may also be obtained by pulverizing
the ground; as pulverization, by admitting
the rain to percolate slowly through the soil,
enables it to absorb and retain sufficient
moisture to afford a proper and equable supply
of food to the spongioles, without suffering
the surplus water to remain so as to be
in danger of rotting the main roots.</p>

<p>These then are the reasons why it may
be laid down as a general rule, that all
ground should be stirred before seeds are
sown in it; but there are other reasons which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
operate only partially, and are yet almost as
necessary to be attended to. When manure
is applied, the ground is generally well dug,
in order to mix the manure intimately with
the soil; and when the soil appears worn
out, or poisoned with excrementitious matter,
from the same kind of plants being too long
grown in it, it is trenched; that is, the upper
or surface soil is taken off by spadefuls and
laid on one side, and the bottom or sub-soil
is taken out to a certain depth previously
agreed on, and laid in another heap. The
surface soil is then thrown into the bottom
of the trench, and the sub-soil laid on the
surface, and thus a completely new and fresh
soil is offered to the plants. These partial
uses of digging should, however, always be
applied with great caution, as in some cases
manure does better laid on the surface, so
that its juices only may drain into the
ground, than when it is intimately mixed
with the soil; and there are cases when, from
the sub-soil being of an inferior quality,
trenching must be manifestly injurious. Reason
and experience are, in these cases, as
in most others, the best guides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The uses of digging having been thus
explained, it is now necessary to say something
of its practice, and particularly of its
applicability to ladies. It must be confessed
that digging appears, at first sight, a very
laborious employment, and one peculiarly
unfitted to small and delicately formed hands
and feet; but, by a little attention to the
principles of mechanics and the laws of motion,
the labour may be much simplified and
rendered comparatively easy. The operation
of digging, as performed by a gardener,
consists in thrusting the iron part of the
spade, which acts as a wedge, perpendicularly
into the ground by the application of
the foot, and then using the long handle as a
lever, to raise up the loosened earth and turn
it over. The quantity of earth thus raised
is called a spitful, and the gardener, when
he has turned it, chops it to break the
clods, with the sharp edge of his spade, and
levels it with the back. During the whole
operation, the gardener holds the cross part
of the handle of the spade in his right-hand,
while he grasps the smooth round lower part
of the handle in his left, to assist him in raising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the earth and turning it, sliding his left hand
backwards and forwards along the handle, as
he may find it necessary.</p>

<p>This is the common mode of digging, and
it certainly appears to require considerable
strength in the foot to force the spade into
the ground,—in the arms to raise it when
loaded with the earth that is to be turned
over,—and in the hands to grasp the handle.
But it must be remembered that all operations
that are effected rapidly by the exertion
of great power, may be effected slowly by
the exertion of very little power, if that comparatively
feeble power be applied for a much
greater length of time. For example, if a
line be drawn by a child in the earth with
a light cane, and the cane be drawn five or
six times successively along the same line,
it will be found that a furrow has been made
in the soil with scarcely any exertion by the
child, that the strongest man could not
make by a single effort with all his force.
In the same way a lady, with a small light
spade may, by taking time, succeed in doing
all the digging that can be required in a
small garden, the soil of which, if it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
long in cultivation, can never be very hard
or difficult to penetrate, and she will not only
have the satisfaction of seeing the garden
created, as it were, by the labour of her own
hands, but she will find her health and
spirits wonderfully improved by the exercise,
and by the reviving smell of the fresh

</div>

<p>The first point to be attended to, in order
to render the operation of digging less laborious,
is to provide a suitable spade; that
is, one which shall be as light as is consistent
with strength, and which will penetrate
the ground with the least possible trouble.
For this purpose, the blade of what is
called a lady’s spade is made of not more
than half the usual breadth, say not wider
than five inches or six inches, and of smooth
polished iron, and it is surmounted, at the
part where it joins the handle, by a piece of
iron rather broader than itself, which is
called the tread, to serve as a rest for the
foot of the operator while digging. The
handle is about the usual length, but quite
smooth and sufficiently slender for a lady’s
hand to grasp it, and it is made of willow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>a close, smooth, and elastic wood, which is
tough and tolerably strong, though much
lighter than ash, the wood generally used for
the handles to gardeners’ spades. The lady
should also be provided with clogs,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the soles
of which are not jointed, to put over her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>shoes, or if she should dislike these and prefer
strong shoes, she should be provided with
what gardeners call a tramp, that is, a small
plate of iron to go under the sole of the shoe,
and which is fastened round the foot with
a leathern strap and buckle. She should
also have a pair of stiff thick leathern gloves,
or gauntlets, to protect her hands, not only
from the handle of the spade, but from the
stones, weeds, &amp;c., which she may turn over
with the earth, and which ought to be picked
out and thrown into a small, light wheel-barrow,
which may easily be moved from
place to place.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Perhaps the most useful covering for the feet is a kind
of clog and gaiter combined; which may be made of some
soft elastic leather, and rendered perfectly waterproof, by
the new preparation which is now employed instead of
caoutchouc, and is preferable to that gum, as it does not
impede perspiration.</p>

</div>

<p>A wheel-barrow is a lever of the second
kind, in which the weight is carried between
the operator, who is the moving power, and
the fulcrum, which is represented by the
lower part of the wheel. If it be so contrived
that the wheel may roll on a plank, or
on firm ground, a very slight power is sufficient
to move the load contained in the barrow;
particularly if the handles be long,
curved, and thrown up as high as possible, in
order to let the weight rest principally upon
the wheel, without obliging the operator to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
bend forward. When, on the contrary, the
handles are short and straight, the weight
is thrown principally on the arms of the operator,
and much more strength is required
to move the load, besides the inconvenience
of stooping.</p>

<p>All the necessary implements for digging
being provided, the next thing to be considered
is the easiest manner of performing
the operation. The usual way is for the
gardener to thrust his spade perpendicularly
into the ground, and then using the handle
as a lever, to draw it back so as to raise the
whole mass of earth in front of the spade at
once. This requires great strength; but by
inserting the spade in a slanting direction,
and throwing the body slightly forward at
the same time, the mass of earth to be
raised will not only be much less, but the
body of the operator will be in a much more
convenient position for raising and turning
it; which may thus be done with perfect
ease.</p>

<p>The time for digging should always be
chosen, if possible, when the ground is tolerably
dry; not only on account of the danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of taking cold by standing on the damp
earth, but because the soil, when damp, adheres
to the spade, and is much more difficult
to work (as the gardeners call it,) than
when it is dry. The ground in fields, &amp;c.
becomes very hard in dry weather; but this
is never the case in a garden, the soil of
which is well pulverized by the constant digging,
forking, hoeing and raking it must
undergo, to keep the garden tolerably neat.
Every lady should be careful, when she has
finished digging, to have her spade dipped
in water, and then wiped dry; after which
it should be hung up in some warm dry shed,
or harness room, to keep it free from rust;
as nothing lessens the labour of digging more
than having a perfectly smooth and polished
spade. Should the earth adhere to the spade
while digging, dipping the blade in water
occasionally, will be found to facilitate the
operation.</p>

<p>The purposes for which digging is applied
in gardening are: simple digging for loosening
the soil in order to prepare it for a crop;
pointing; burying manure; exposing the soil
to the action of the weather; trenching;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
ridging; forming pits for planting trees and
shrubs, or for filling with choice soil for
sowing seeds; and taking up plants when
they are to be removed.</p>

<p>In simple digging, as well as in most of
the other kinds, it is customary to divide the
bed to be dug, by a garden-line, into two
parts: a trench, or furrow as it is called, is
then opened across one of these divisions or
half of the bed, the earth out of which is
thrown up into a heap. The digging then
commences by turning over a breadth of soil
into the furrow thus made, and thus forming
a new furrow to be filled up by the soil turned
over from the breadth beyond it; and this is
continued till the operator reaches the end
of the first division, where the furrow is to
be filled with the earth taken from the first
furrow of the second division; after which
the digging proceeds regularly as before, till
the operator reaches the last furrow, which is
filled with the ridge of earth thrown up when
the first furrow was made. As few ladies are
strong enough to throw the earth from the
heap where it was laid from the first furrow
to fill the last, the best way is to put it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
a small wheel-barrow, which may be wheeled
to the place required, and filled and emptied
as often as may be found convenient; or the
ground may be divided into narrower strips.
It must also be observed, that as a spitful of
earth taken up obliquely will be seldom
found enough to loosen the soil to a proper
depth, a second or even a third should be
taken from the same place before the operator
advances any further along the line. Or the
whole of each furrow may first be made shallow,
and then deepened by successive diggings
before proceeding to the next furrow.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the great art in this kind
of digging is to keep the furrows straight, and
not to take up more earth in one place than
in another, so that the surface of the ground,
when finished, may be perfectly even. To
keep the furrows straight, the first ought to
be worked out with the rod and line, and
every succeeding line should be frequently
and carefully examined. It is more difficult
to keep these lines straight than can be at
first sight imagined; and in proportion as the
furrow is allowed to become crooked it will
become narrower, and be in danger of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
choked up; or, if kept as wide as before, the
surface of the ground will be rendered uneven,
and the last furrow left without earth
enough to fill it up. In digging each furrow
also, care must be taken to carry it quite up
to the line of demarcation; as, otherwise,
what the gardeners call a baulk or piece of
firm land would be left there, and, of course,
the bed would neither look well, nor would
the object for which it was dug be fully attained.
Great care must also be taken to
keep the surface of the bed even, and this
it is extremely difficult for a novice to do. It
is, indeed, very provoking, after watching
the ease with which a gardener digs a bed,
and looking at the perfectly smooth and even
surface that he leaves, to find how very hard
it is to imitate him; and yet it is essentially
necessary to be done, for if there are any
irregularities in the surface, the hollow places
will collect the moisture, and the plants in
them will grow vigorously, while those in the
raised places will be speedily dried by the
sun and wind, and will look poor and
withered. Practice is certainly required to
render digging easy, but, as the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
points of keeping the furrows straight and
the surface even, depend on skill more than
strength, the art of digging well may be acquired
by any one who thinks it worth while
to take the trouble. Very little strength will,
indeed, be necessary, if the rule of thrusting
in the spade obliquely, and aiding it
by the momentum of the body be always
attended to.</p>

<p><i>Pointing</i>, as it is called by gardeners, is in
fact shallow digging, and it consists in merely
turning over the ground to the depth of two
or three inches. In spring, or in the beginning
of summer, when the sun has only
warmed the soil to the depth of a few inches,
and when the seeds to be sown (as of annual
flowers for example) are wanted to germinate
as quickly as possible, pointing is preferable
to digging; because the latter operation would
bury the warm soil, and bring that up to the
surface which is still as cold as in winter.
Pointing is also used in stirring the ground
among trees and other plants, in order that
the spade may not go so deeply into the
ground as to injure their roots.</p>

<p><i>Burying manure.</i>—There are two ways of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
digging the ground for the purpose of burying
manure: according to the first method,
the manure is spread evenly over the whole
bed, and then the gardener proceeds to dig as
though the manure were in fact a portion of
the surface of the soil; and according to the
second method, the manure having been first
brought to the spot and thrown into a heap,
is deposited, a small portion at a time, at the
bottom of each furrow as it is formed, and
the earth from the next furrow thrown over
it. In both cases, the manure should be
buried as speedily as possible; as if left long
exposed in small quantities to the air in hot
dry weather, it loses a great part of its nutritious
qualities by evaporation.</p>

<p>Digging for the purpose of exposing the
soil to the action of the weather, trenching,
and ridging on a large scale, are operations
too laborious to be performed by any one
but a gardener’s labourer. To be done well,
the earth in all these cases should be mixed
in large spitfuls at a time, and turned over
without breaking, on which account they are
best performed in moist weather, when the
earth is in an adhesive state. Ridging on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
small scale may be useful in a flower garden,
when the soil is much infested with insects,
or where there are many weeds. It is performed
by opening a trench, and throwing
up the earth out of it in the form of a ridge;
and then opening another trench, and forming
another ridge in the same manner. The
whole garden is thus thrown into a series of
ridges and trenches, which should be suffered
to remain all the winter, and be levelled in
spring. It is obvious that this mode of ameliorating
the soil can only be practised where
the garden is not likely to be visited during
winter, as it destroys all beauty, and has a
peculiarly desolate and forlorn appearance.
It is indeed a remedy only to be resorted
to in extreme cases, but fortunately there are
very few flower gardens in which the soil
is in so bad a state as to require it.</p>

<p>The other kinds of digging, are to form pits
for receiving plants, or for filling with choice
soil, and to remove plants. In the first case,
a hole of sufficient size to receive the plant is
dug, and the earth thrown up beside it, to be
filled in round the roots of the plant; and in
the second case, the common garden earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
is thrown out of a pit a foot or eighteen
inches deep, and about the same in diameter,
and its place supplied by peat, or whatever
other kind of earth may be required. In
removing a young tree or shrub, the ground
is generally first dug out on one side, so as to
form a small trench, and then the spade is
driven perpendicularly into the ground, below
the depth to which the roots descend,
and the whole mass is raised like a spade
full of earth. Small plants are raised by the
spade at once without making any trench;
and large trees require all the skill of a professed
gardener.</p>

<p><i>Forking.</i>—A broad-pronged garden fork
may be defined as an implement consisting
of a number of small sharply pointed spades,
united by a shoulder or hilt, to which is fixed
the handle; and forking differs from digging
principally in its being used merely to stir
the soil, and not to turn it over. In shrubberies,
and among perennial herbaceous
plants, which are not to be taken and replanted,
forking is very useful; as it loosens
the hard dry surface of the soil, and admits
the warm air and rain to the roots of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
plants. This is very necessary, as the earth
is a bad conductor of heat; and where the
surface of the soil is become so hard as to
exclude the air from the roots of the plants,
the ground in which they grow will be nearly
as cold in summer as in winter. Besides,
when the surface of the ground is hard, the
rain instead of soaking gradually into it, runs
off, or evaporates, without being of any service
to the roots. The operation of forking consists
merely in thrusting the fork a little way
into the ground by the application of the foot
to the hilt, and then raising the ground by
pulling back the handle as in digging, so as
to loosen the earth without raising it. The
ground may thus be roughly pulverized to a
considerable depth, without dividing the
roots of the plants; which would have been
inevitable if the operator had used a spade.</p>

<p><i>Hoeing.</i>—There are several different kinds
of hoes which are used for getting up weeds,
for loosening the soil, for drawing it up round
the stems of growing plants, and for making
a shallow furrow or drill for sowing seeds.
The different kinds all belong to two great
divisions: viz. the draw hoe and the thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
hoe, which may be seen at any ironmonger’s
shop. Either kind may be used for destroying
weeds; as the weeds may either be
loosened and lifted out of the soil by the
thrust hoe, or torn out of it by the draw hoe.
Both kinds may also be used for pulverizing
the soil, or a third kind with two prongs may
be substituted. In all these operations, the
thrust hoe is best adapted for a lady’s use,
as requiring the least exertion of strength,
and being most easily managed; but the
draw hoe is best adapted for making a drill
or furrow for the reception of seeds, and also
for the last and most important use of hoeing,
viz. the drawing up of the earth round the
stems of growing plants.</p>

<p>The operation of hoeing up, though very
commonly practised, is only suitable to some
kind of plants, and it is intended to afford
additional nourishment to those which have
tap-roots, by inducing them to throw out
more lateral fibres.</p>

<p>The plants which will bear to be hoed or
earthed up, are those that throw out fibrous
roots above the vital knot, like the cabbage
tribe, &amp;c.; or that are annuals with long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
bushy stems, and very weak and slender roots
like the pea. Ligneous plants should never
be earthed up, to avoid injuring the vital
knot, which forms the point of separation
between the main root and the stem, and
which gardeners call the collar, crown, neck
or collet. This part in trees and shrubs
should never be buried, as if it be injured
by moisture so as to cause it to rot; or if it
be wounded in any way, the plant will die.
A deciduous tree may be cut down close
above the collar, and it will throw up fresh
shoots, or the roots may all be cut off close
below the collar, and if that part be uninjured
fresh roots will form; but if a tree
be cut through at this vital part it never
can recover.</p>

<p>A trowel is another instrument used
in stirring the soil, but of course it can
only be employed in boxes of earth in balconies,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Raking</i> is useful in smoothing the soil after
digging, and in collecting weeds, stones, &amp;c.,
and dragging them to one side, where they
may be easily removed. An iron-toothed
rake is generally used for the ground, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
wooden one for collecting grass after mowing.
When it is wished that the teeth of the rake
should enter the ground, the handle should
be held low; but if the object be the collection
of weeds, &amp;c., the handle should be held
high. Dry weather is essential to raking the
ground, as the principal use of the operation
is to break the clods left by the spade; but
raking together grass or weeds may be performed
in wet weather.</p>

<p>The degree of strength required for raking
depends partly upon the breadth of the head
of the rake, and the number of its teeth, but
principally upon the manner of holding it.
If the rake be held low, it is obvious that
greater strength will be required to drag it
through the ground than if it is held high,
in which case very little labour will be required
to overcome the resistance it will meet
with.</p>

</div>

<p class="c less sp">MANURING THE SOIL AND MAKING HOTBEDS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Most</span> persons imagine that manure is all
that is wanted to make a garden fruitful;
and thus, if the fruit-trees do not bear, and
the flowers and vegetables do not thrive,
manure is considered the universal panacea.
Now, the fact is, that so far from this being
the case, most small gardens have been manured
a great deal too much; and in many,
the surface soil, instead of consisting of rich
friable mould, only presents a soft black
shining substance, which is the humic acid
from the manure saturated with stagnant
water. No appearance is more common in
the gardens of street-houses than this, from
these gardens being originally ill drained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and yet continually watered; and from their
possessors loading them with manure, in the
hope of rendering them fertile.</p>

<p>As it is known to chemists that it is only
the humic acid, and carbonic acid gas, contained
in manure, which make that substance
nourishing to plants; and as these acids
must be dissolved in water before the roots
can take them up, it may seem strange that
any solution of them in water, however
strong it may be, should be injurious to
vegetation. The fact is, however, that it is
the great quantity of food contained in the
water that renders it unwholesome. When
the roots of a plant and their little sponge-like
terminations, are examined in a powerful
microscope, it will be clearly seen that
no thick substance can pass through them.
Thus water loaded with gross coarse matter,
as it is when saturated with humic acid,
must be more than the poor spongioles can
swallow; and yet, as they are truly sponge-like,
their nature prompts them, whenever
they find moisture, to attempt to take it up,
without having the power of discriminating
between what is good for them, and what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
will be injurious. The spongioles thus imbibe
the saturated liquid; and, loaded with
this improper food, the fibrous roots, like
an overgorged snake, become distended, the
fine epidermis that covers them is torn
asunder, their power of capillary attraction
is gone, and they can neither force the food
they have taken up, into the main roots,
nor reject the excrementitious matter sent
down to them from the leaves, after the elaboration
of the sap. In this state of things,
from the usual circulation of the fluids being
impeded, it is not surprising that the plant
should droop, that its leaves should turn yellow,
that its flowers should not expand,
that its fruit should shrivel and drop off
prematurely, and that in the end it should
die; as, in fact, it may be said to expire of
apoplexy, brought on by indigestion.</p>

<p>All soil, to be in a fit state for growing
plants, should be sufficiently loose and dry
to allow of water passing through it intermixed
with air; as water, when in this state
is never more than slightly impregnated with
the nutritious juices of the manure through
which it has passed. The spongioles are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
thus not supplied with more food at a time
than they can properly take up and digest,
and a healthy circulation of the fluids is
kept up through the whole plant. But,
what, it may be asked, is to be done with a
garden, the soil of which has become black
and slimy like half-rotten peat? The quickest
remedy is covering it with lime, as that
combines readily with the humic acid, and
reduces it to a state of comparative dryness:
or, if the sub-soil be good, the ground
may be trenched, and the surface-soil buried
two spits deep; in either case it will be necessary
thoroughly to drain the garden to
prevent a recurrence of the evil.</p>

<p><i>All the different kinds of soil</i> found on
level ground, consist of two parts, which are
called the surface-soil and the sub-soil; and
as the sub-soil always consists of one of
the three primitive earths, so do these earths
always enter, more or less, into the composition
of every kind of surface-soil. The
primitive earths are—silex, (which includes
sand and gravel,) clay, and lime, which includes
also chalk; and most sub-soils consist
of a solid bed or rock of one or other of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
materials, probably in nearly the same state
as it was left by the deluge. The surface-soils,
on the contrary, are of comparatively
recent date; and they have been slowly
formed by the gradual crumbling of the sub-soil,
and its inter-mixture with decayed
animal and vegetable matter, and with other
soils which may have been accidentally
washed down upon, or purposely brought
to it. In fields, and uncultivated places, the
surface-soil is almost as hard, and as coarse
in its texture, as the sub-soil on which it
rests; but in gardens which have been long
in cultivation, the surface-soil becomes so
thoroughly pulverized by frequent diggings,
and so mixed with the manure and decayed
vegetables which have been added to it
from time to time, that it is changed into
the soft, light, fine, powdery substance, called
garden-mould. If the sub-soil be naturally
porous or well drained, this mould, however
rich it may be made by the addition of decayed
vegetable matter or animal manure,
will always continue friable; and as long as
it does so, it will be fit for the growth of
plants: but if no vent be allowed for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
escape of the water, and it be continually
enriched with manure, it will be changed
in time into the black slimy substance that
has been already described.</p>

<p>Surface-soil is called peat-earth when it
is composed of decayed vegetable matter,
without any mixture of animal manure; and,
as this excess of vegetable matter could
neither be produced nor decayed, without
abundance of stagnant moisture, this kind
of earth is almost always found on a clayey
sub-soil, which prevents the water which falls
upon it from escaping. Peat-earth has a
spongy, elastic feeling when trodden upon,
arising from the quantity of water that it
holds, and it can only be rendered fit for
cultivation by draining. In its elastic state
it is what is called in Scotland a moss, and
in England a peat-bog. Should the water,
instead of being afforded a vent by drainage,
be suffered to accumulate for many years,
till it completely saturates the peat, the soil
becomes what is called a morass, or quagmire;
and it can no longer be trodden on, as
it will engulf any substance resting upon it.
A still further accumulation of water will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
in the course of years, cause the bog to burst
its bounds, and overflow the surrounding
country; as the Solway-moss did many years
ago, and as bogs in Ireland have done frequently.
An excess of vegetable matter on
a silicious sub-soil, differs from the common
black-peat in retaining less water; and in
being mixed with a portion of the primitive
earth, which, from its loose texture, becomes
easily detached from the sub-soil.
Peat in this state is called heath mould.</p>

<p>The most productive soils are those in
which several ingredients are combined in
proper proportions; and if any one of the
primitive earths preponderates, the soil becomes
comparatively unfertile. Thus the
best soil for gardening purposes is generally
allowed to be a calcareous loam on a chalky
sub-soil; and this sort of soil is composed of
nearly equal parts of lime, sand, and clay,
enriched depositions of decayed animal and
vegetable matter. The next best soil is a
sandy loam, composed of clay and sand, enriched
by decayed animal and vegetable
substances, and resting on a sandy or gravelly
sub-soil. The worst soils are peat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
sand. A poor sandy soil is necessarily a
nearly barren one; because it will not retain
either water, or the nutritious juices from manure,
long enough to afford nourishment to
the plants grown upon it; and it is obvious
that a soil of this kind can only be rendered
fertile by mixing it with clay; which would
change it into a sandy loam.</p>

<p>A stiff clay is unfertile from its attracting
moisture and retaining it round the roots
of the plants till they become swollen and
unhealthy. It also retards the decomposition
of manure, and obstructs the progress of
the roots, which waste their strength in the efforts
they make to penetrate, or twine round,
its adhesive clods. Soils of this description
are improved by a mixture of sand, gravel,
road grit, or any substance which tends to
separate the particles of the clay, and to render
it light and friable.</p>

<p>Chalky soils succeed better unmixed, than
any of the other kinds; but chalk being
a carbonate of lime, can hardly be called a
primitive soil. The chalk, however, from its
whiteness is colder than any other soil; as
it does not absorb, but reflects back the rays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of the sun. Rain also penetrates into it
very slowly, and not to any great depth.
Chalk mixed with sand forms a kind of calcareous
loam admirably adapted for growing
vegetables; and chalky soils are peculiarly
susceptible of improvement from manure.</p>

<p><i>Manures.</i>—The kinds of manure generally
used in gardens are horse or cow dung, and
decayed vegetable matters; the manure in
both cases being suffered to lie in a heap to
rot before it is spread on the ground, in
order that its component parts may be decomposed
by fermentation, and thus brought
into a fit state to afford food to the plants.
Old hot-beds or mushroom beds are thus
well adapted for manuring a garden; and
when fresh stable-dung is employed for that
purpose, it is generally thrown into a heap,
and turned over several times till the fermentation
has abated, before it is dug into
the ground. As, however, a great quantity
of carbonic acid gas is evolved and escapes
during the process of fermentation, and as it
seems a great pity that so much of the nutritious
properties of the manure should be
lost, it is now customary to cover the dunghill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
with earth, into which the gases will rise
during the process of fermentation, and in
which they will deposit the greater part of
their nutritious properties. A quantity of
earth should also be laid round the dunghill
to imbibe the liquid that runs from it, and
this earth, part of which must be removed
and fresh added every time the dunghill is
turned over, will be found very nearly as valuable
for manuring the beds of a garden,
as the manure itself.</p>

<p><i>The modes of applying manure</i> differ according
to the difference of the soils. For
sandy loams, thoroughly rotten dung, either
from an old hotbed, or from a dunghill sufficiently
decayed to be cut easily with the
spade, or the earth that has covered a dunghill
during the process of fermentation, should
be laid on the surface of the soil, and dug in.
In very poor sandy soils rotten manure, or
earth from a dunghill, should be laid on the
surface of the soil, and not dug in: being
covered, if hot dry weather be expected,
with leaves, straw, or the branches of trees
cut off in pruning; or occasionally sprinkled
with water. Soils of this description, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
loose sands, are frequently improved in the
South of France and Italy, by sowing them
with seeds of the common white lupine, and
then, when the plants have come up and
grown about a foot high, ploughing or digging
them into the soil. The green succulent
stems of the lupines, when thus buried
in the soil, supply it with moisture during
the process of their decay; and thus nourishment
is afforded to the corn, which is immediately
afterwards sown upon the soil for a
crop. Clayey soils should have unfermented
manure mixed with undecayed straw laid in
the bottom of the furrows made in digging;
that the process of fermentation, and the remains
of the straw may operate in keeping
the particles of the soil open, or, in other
words, in preventing their too close adhesion.
Lime (though when burnt it becomes violently
caustic, and will destroy and waste all
the manure applied with it), as carbonate of
lime, or chalk (in which state only it can
properly be called a soil), retains the manure
applied to it longer than any other soil.
Rotten manure may thus be dug into chalk,
with the certainty that it will be preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
from farther decay for a very long time, and
that every shower will work a small portion
of its fertilizing juices out of it, and carry
them into the soil, where they will be thus
presented to the plants in the best possible
state for affording wholesome food.</p>

<p>Peat soils may be improved by the addition
of quick-lime as a manure, which will absorb
the superabundant moisture which they contain;
or they may be mixed with sand, gravel,
or clay to give them firmness and tenacity,
and then with a small quantity of animal
manure. Sandy peat or heath mould is very
useful in gardens for growing heaths, rhododendrons,
kalmias, or any plants with fine
hair-like roots; and from the quantity of
vegetable matter that it contains naturally,
it does not require any manure, more than
what is furnished by the decaying leaves of
the plants grown in it.</p>

<p>Nearly the same rules apply to decaying
leaves and other substances used as manure,
as to stable-dung. They may be buried in
an undecayed state in clayey soil, when it is
the object to separate the adhesive particles
of the clay by the process of fermentation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
but their component parts should be separated
by fermentation before they are applied
as a manure to growing plants. Vegetable
mould (that is, leaves thoroughly decayed
and mixed with a little rich loam) is admirably
adapted for manuring the finer kinds of
flowers, and plants in pots. There are many
other kinds of manure used in gardens occasionally;
such as the dung of pigs, rabbits
and poultry, grass mown from lawns, parings
of leather, horn shavings, bones, the sweeping
of streets, the emptying of privies, cess-pools,
and sewers, the clipping of hedges and pruning
of trees, weeds, the refuse of vegetables,
pea halm, &amp;c. All these should be fermented,
and applied, in the same manner as the common
kinds of manure.</p>

<p><i>The following is a summary of the general
rules to be observed in manuring and improving
soils</i>:—Never to use animal manure and
quick-lime together, as the one will destroy
the other. To use lime as a manure only in
very sandy or peaty soils, or in soils abounding
with sulphate of iron. To remember
that rotten manure is considered to give solidity;
and that unfermented manure, buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in trenching, has a tendency to lighten the
soil. To dilute liquid manure from a dunghill
with water, before applying it to growing
plants; as otherwise, from the quantity
of ammonia that it contains it will be apt to
burn them. To cover and surround dunghills
with earth during the process of fermentation,
to absorb the nutritious gases,
that would otherwise escape. To remember
that the manure of cows and all animals that
chew the cud, is cold and suited to a light
soil; and that the manure of horses, pigs,
and poultry is hot and suited to a firm soil:
also that all manure, when well rotten, becomes
cold in its nature, and should be
treated accordingly. To remember that all
mixed soils are more fertile than soils consisting
only of one of the three primitive
earths, viz. lime, sand, or clay; and never
to forget that too much manure is quite as
injurious to plants as too little.</p>

<p><i>Formation of hotbeds.</i>—Though nearly all
the kinds of manure which have been enumerated
may be used occasionally for hotbeds,
the only materials in common use in gardens,
are stable manure, dead leaves, and tan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
The first of these, which is by far the most
general, consists partly of horse-dung, and
partly of what gardeners call long litter, that
is, straw moistened and discoloured, but not
decayed. The manure is generally in this
state, when it is purchased, or taken from
the stable, for the purpose of making a hot-bed.</p>

<p>The necessary quantity of manure is procured
at the rate of one cart load, or from
twelve to fifteen large wheel-barrowfuls to
every light, as the gardeners call the sashes
of the frames, each light being about three
feet wide; and this manure is laid in a heap to
ferment. The heap should then be covered
with earth to receive the gases evolved during
fermentation, and earth laid round it to
absorb the liquid manure that may drain
from it. In about a week the earth may be
removed, and the manure turned over with
a dung-fork, and well shaken together; this
operation being repeated two or three or
more times, at intervals of two or three days,
till the whole mass is become of one colour,
and the straws are sufficiently decomposed to
be torn to pieces with the fork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>The size of the hotbed must depend principally
on the size of the frame which is to
cover it; observing that the bed must be
from six inches to a foot wider than the frame
every way. The manure must then be
spread in layers, each layer being beaten
down with the back of the fork, till the bed
is about three feet and a half high. The surface
of the ground on which the hotbed is
built, is generally raised about six inches
above the general surface of the garden; and
it is advisable to lay some earth round the
bottom of the bed, nearly a foot wide, that
it may receive the juices of the manure that
will drain from the bed. As soon as the
bed is made, the frame is put on and the
sashes kept quite close, till a steam appears
upon the glass, when the bed is considered
in a fit state to be covered three or four
inches deep with mould; observing, if the
bed has settled unequally, to level the surface
of the manure before covering it with earth.
The seeds to be raised may either be sown
in this earth, or in pots to be plunged
in it.</p>

<p><i>The proper average heat</i> for a hotbed intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
to raise flower seeds, or to grow cucumbers,
is 60°: but melons require a heat
of 65° to grow in, and 75° to ripen their
fruit. This heat should be taken in a morning,
and does not include that of the sun in
the middle of the day. When the heat of the
bed becomes so great as to be in danger of
injuring the plants, the obvious remedy is to
give air by raising the glasses; and if this be
not sufficient, the general heat of the bed
must be lowered by making excavations in
the dung from the sides, so as to reach nearly
to the middle of the bed, and filling up these
excavations with cold dung which has already
undergone fermentation, or with leaves, turf,
or any other similar material which will receive
heat, but not increase it. When the
heat of the bed falls down to 48° or lower, it
should be raised, by applying on the outside
fresh coatings of dung, grass, or leaves, which
are called linings.</p>

<p>When hotbeds are made of spent tanner’s
bark or decayed leaves, a kind of box or pit
must be formed of bricks or boards, or even
of layers of turf, or clay, and the tan or
leaves filled in so as to make a bed. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
neatness is an object, this kind of bed is preferable
to any other; but a common hotbed
of stable manure may be made to look neat
by thatching the outside with straw, or covering
it with bast mats, pegged down to keep
them close to the bed.</p>

<p class="c less sp">SOWING SEEDS—PLANTING BULBS AND<br>
TUBERS—TRANSPLANTING AND WATERING.</p>


<p><i>Sowing Seeds.</i>—The principal points to be
attended to in sowing seeds are, first, to prepare
the ground so that the young and tender
roots thrown out by the seeds may easily
penetrate into it; secondly, to fix the seeds
firmly in the soil; thirdly, to cover them, so
as to exclude the light, which impedes vegetation,
and to preserve a sufficiency of moisture
round them to encourage it; and,
fourthly, not to bury them so deeply as either
to deprive them of the beneficial influence of
the air, or to throw any unnecessary impediments
in the way of their ascending shoots.</p>

<p>The preparation of the soil has been already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
described in the chapter on digging, and
the reasons why it is necessary have been
there given; but why seeds should be firmly
embedded in it, seems to require explanation.
It is well known that gardeners, before
they either sow a bed in the kitchen-garden,
or a patch of flower-seeds in the flower-garden,
generally “firm the ground,” as they
call it, by beating it well with the back of
the spade, or pressing it with the saucer of
a flower-pot; and there can be no doubt
that this is done in order that the seeds may
be firmly imbedded in the soil. When
lawns are sown with grass-seeds also, the
seeds are frequently rolled in, evidently for
the same purpose. The only question, therefore,
is, why is this necessary; and the answer
appears to be, that a degree of permanence
and stability is essential to enable
nature to accommodate the plant to the situation
in which it is placed. When there is
this degree of permanence and stability, it
is astonishing to observe the efforts that
plants will make to provide for their wants;
but without it, seeds will not even vegetate.
Thus we often see large trees springing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
from crevices in apparently bare rocks; while
not even a blade of grass will grow among
the moving sands of a desert.</p>

<p>The reasons for the second and third points
of covering the seeds, and yet not covering
them too deeply, appear more obvious; and
yet they also require a little explanation.
The seeds are covered to keep them in darkness,
and to retain round them a proper
quantity of moisture; not only to make them
swell and begin to vegetate, but to enable
the roots to perform their proper functions;
since, if exposed to the air, they would become
dry and withered, and lose the power
of contracting and dilating, which is essential
to enable them to imbibe and digest
their food. Burying the seeds too deeply is
obviously injurious in impeding the progress
of the young shoot to the light; and in
placing it in an unnatural position. When
a seed vegetates too far below the surface, a
part of the stem of the plant must be buried;
and this part not being intended to remain
under-ground, is not protected from the
dangers it is likely to meet with there. It
is thus peculiarly liable to be assailed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
slugs and all kinds of insects, and to become
rotten by damp, or withered by heat. It is
also very possible to bury a seed so deeply
as to prevent it from vegetating at all. The
ground has more of both warmth and moisture
near the surface than at a great depth, as it
is warmed by the rays of the sun, and
moistened by the rain; but besides this, seeds
will not vegetate, even when they are amply
supplied with heat and moisture, if they are
excluded from the influence of the air. Every
ripe seed in a dry state is a concentration of
carbon, which, when dissolved by moisture,
and its particles set in motion by heat, is
in a fit state to combine with the oxygen
in the atmosphere, and thus to form the carbonic
acid gas which is the nourishment of
the expanding plant. For this reason, seeds,
and newly sprung-up plants do not want to
be supplied with manure, and air is much
more essential to them: they have enough
carbon in their cotyledons or seed-leaves,
and they only want oxygen to combine with
it, to enable them to develope their other
leaves; and this is the reason why young
plants, raised on a hotbed, are always given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
air, or they become yellow and withered.
Light absorbs the oxygen from plants, and
occasions a deposition of the carbon. Thus
seeds and seedlings do not require much
light; it is indeed injurious to them, as it
undoes in some degree what the air has been
doing for them: but young plants, when they
have expanded two or three pairs of leaves,
and when the stock of carbon contained in
their cotyledons, or seed-leaves, is exhausted,
require light to enable them to elaborate
their sap, without which the process of vegetation
could not go on. Abundance of
light also is favourable to the development
of flowers, and the ripening of seeds; as it
aids the concentration of carbon, which they
require to make them fertile. The curious
fact that seeds, though abundantly supplied
with warmth and moisture, will not vegetate
without the assistance of the air, was lately
verified in Italy; where the Po, having overflowed
its banks near Mantua, deposited a
great quantity of mud on some meadows;
and from this mud sprang up a plentiful crop
of black poplars, no doubt from seeds that
had fallen into the river from a row of trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of that kind, which had formerly grown on
its banks, but which had been cut down many
years previously. Another instance occurred
in the case of some raspberry seeds found in
the body of an ancient Briton discovered in
a tumulus in Dorsetshire. Some of these
seeds were sown in the London Horticultural
Society’s Garden at Turnham Green,
where they vegetated, and the plants produced
from them are still (1839) growing.
Numerous other nearly similar instances, will
be found in <i>Jesse’s Gleanings</i>, <i>Hooker’s Botanical
Miscellany</i>, and numerous other works.
Steeping seeds in oxalic acid, &amp;c. to make
them vegetate, is efficacious; as there is a
speedier combination between the carbon in
the seeds, and the oxygen in the acid, than
can be effected by the ordinary agency of
the air in parting with its oxygen to them.</p>

<p><i>Planting bulbs and tubers</i> bears considerable
analogy to sowing seeds. The bulb
or tuber may indeed be considered as only
a seed of larger growth, since it requires the
combined influence of air, warmth, and
moisture to make it vegetate, and then it
throws out a stem, leaves, and roots like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
seed. There is, however, one important difference
between them; the seed expends its
accumulated stock of carbon in giving birth
to the root, stem, and leaves, after which it
withers away and disappears; while the bulb
or tuber continues to exist during the whole
life of the plant, and appears to contain a
reservoir of carbon, which it only parts with
slowly, and as circumstances may require.
Though bulbs and tubers have here been
mentioned as almost synonymous, modern
botanists make several distinctions between
them. The tunicated bulbs, such as those
of the hyacinth and the onion, and the
squamose bulbs, such as those of the lily,
they consider to be underground buds; while
tubers such as those of the dahlia, and the
potatoe, and solid bulbs or corms, such as
those of the crocus, they regard as underground
stems.</p>

<p>These distinctions, however, though they
may be interesting to the botanist and
vegetable physiologist, are of little or no
use in practice; the practical gardener treating
bulbs and tubers exactly alike, and
planting them as he would sow a seed: that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
is to say, he fixes them firmly in the ground,
and covers them, but not so deeply as to
exclude the air. In preparing a bed for hyacinths
or other tunicated bulbs, it is necessary
to pulverize the soil to a much greater
depth than for ordinary seeds; as the fibrous
roots of the hyacinth descend perpendicularly
to a considerable depth, as may be seen
when these plants are grown in glasses.
The very circumstance of growing hyacinths
in glasses, where they vegetate and send
down their roots exposed to the full influence
of the light, appears contrary to the
usual effects of light on vegetation; and
indeed the plants are said generally to thrive
best, when the glasses are kept in the dark
till the roots are half grown. However this
may be, it is quite certain that hyacinths
in glasses should never be kept in darkness
when their leaves begin to expand; as, if
there be not abundance of light to occasion
rapid evaporation from the leaves, the plants
will soon become surcharged with moisture
from the quantity constantly supplied to their
roots; and the leaves will turn yellow, and
look flaccid, and unhealthy, while the flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
will be stunted, or will fall off without expanding.</p>

<p><i>Transplanting.</i>—The points to be attended
to in transplanting, are—care in taking up,
to avoid injuring the spongioles of the roots;
planting firmly to enable the plant to take
a secure hold of the soil; shading to prevent
the evaporation from the leaves from being
greater than the plant in its enfeebled state
can support; and watering that it may be
abundantly supplied with food in its new
abode. The first point is to avoid injuring
the roots, and it is only necessary to consider
the construction and uses of these most
important organs to perceive how impossible
it is for the plant to thrive, unless they are
in a perfectly healthy state. Roots generally
consist of two parts; the main roots which
are intended to act as grappling irons to
enable the plants to take a firm hold of the
ground, and the fibrous roots which are intended
to supply the plant with nourishment.
These fibrous roots are most liable to receive
injury from transplanting, as they are
covered with a very fine cellular integument,
so delicate in its texture as to be very easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
bruised; and they each terminate in a number
of small pores of extraordinary delicacy
and susceptibility, which act as little sponges
to imbibe moisture for the use of the plant.
It is well known that these spongioles are
the only means which the plant possesses of
imbibing food, and that if they should be
all cut off, the plant must provide itself with
others, or perish for want of nourishment.
These spongioles are exactly of the nature
of a sponge; they expand at the approach
of moisture, and when surcharged with it,
they contract, and thus force it into the
fibrous roots, the cellular integument of which
dilates to receive it; hence the moisture
is forced, by capillary attraction, as it is supposed,
into the main roots, and thence into
the stem and branches of the plant; circulating
like the blood, and after it has been
elaborated in the leaves, as the blood is in
the lungs, dispensing nourishment to every
part as it goes along.</p>

<p>The roots have no pores but those forming
the spongioles; and only the fibrous roots appear
to possess the power of alternate dilation
and contraction, which power evidently depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
on their cellular tissue being in an entire
and healthy state. Thus, it is quite evident
that if the spongiole of any fibril be crushed,
or even the cellular tissue injured, it can no
longer act as a mouth and throat to convey
food to the plant. When this is the case,
the injured part should be instantly removed;
as its elasticity can never be restored,
and it is much better for the plant to
be forced to throw out a new fibril, than to
be obliged to carry on its circulation weakly
and imperfectly with a diseased one. Whenever
a plant is taken up for transplanting, its
roots should therefore be carefully examined,
and all their injured parts cut off, before it is
replaced in the ground. Deciduous plants,
and particularly trees and shrubs, are generally
transplanted when they are without
their leaves; because at that season they are
in no danger of suffering from the effects of
evaporation.</p>

<p><i>Shading</i> is necessary after transplanting
all plants that retain their leaves; as the evaporation
from the leaves, if exposed to the
full action of the light, would be greater than
the plant could support with a diminished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
number of spongioles. If it were possible to
transplant without injuring the fibrils, and if
the plant were immediately supplied with
plenty of water, shading would not be required;
and, indeed, when plants are turned
out of a pot into the open garden without
breaking the ball of earth round their roots,
they are never shaded. The reason for this
is, that as long as a plant remains where it
was first sown, and under favourable circumstances,
the evaporation from its leaves is exactly
adapted to its powers of absorbing
moisture; it is therefore evident, that if, by
any chance, the number of its mouths be
diminished, the evaporation from its leaves
should be checked also, till the means of
supplying a more abundant evaporation are
restored.</p>

<p><i>The use of watering</i> a transplanted plant,
is as obvious as that of shading. It is simply
to supply the spongioles with an abundance
of food, that the increased quantity imbibed
by each, may, in some degree, supply their
diminished number.</p>

<p><i>All plants will not bear transplanting</i>, and
those that have tap-roots, such as the carrot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
are peculiarly unfitted for it. When plants
having tap-roots are transplanted, it should
be into very light soil, and what is called a
puddle should be made to receive them. To
do this, a hole or pit should be formed, deeper
than the root of the plant, and into this pit
water should be poured and earth thrown in
and stirred so as to half-fill it with mud.
The tap-rooted plant should then be plunged
into the mud, shaking it a little so as to let
the mud penetrate among its fibrous roots,
and the hole should be filled in with light
soil. The plant must afterwards be shaded
longer than is usual with other plants; and
when water is given, it should be poured
down nearer to the main root than in other
cases, as the lateral fibrous roots never spread
far from it. Plants with spreading roots,
when transplanted, should have the pit intended
to receive them made shallow, but
very wide in its diameter; so that the roots
may be spread out in it to their fullest extent,
except those that appear at all bruised
or injured, which, as before directed, should
be cut off with a sharp knife.</p>

<p><i>It is a general rule, in transplanting, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to bury the collar of a plant</i>; though this rule
has some exceptions in the case of annuals.
Some of these, such as balsams, send out
roots from the stem above the collar; and
these plants are always very much improved
by transplanting. Others, the fibrous roots
of which are long and descending, such as
hyacinths, bear transplanting very ill, and
when it is absolutely necessary to remove
them, it should be done with an instrument
called a transplanter; which may be purchased
in any ironmonger’s shop, and the
use of which is to take up a sufficient quantity
of earth with the plant to remove it
without disturbing the roots.</p>

<p><i>The uses of transplanting</i> are various.
When seeds are sown, and the young plants
from them begin to make their appearance,
they will generally be found to be much too
thick; and they will require thinning, either
by drawing some of them out and throwing
them away, or by removing them to another
bed by transplanting. This, in the case of
annuals, is called by the gardeners pricking
out. The young plants are taken up with a
small trowel, and replaced in a hole made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
for them, and the earth pressed round them,
with the same trowel; the only care necessary
being to make them firm at the root,
and yet to avoid injuring the tender spongioles.
Gardeners do this with a dibber,
which they hold in the right hand, and after
putting in the young plant with the left
hand, they press the earth round it with the
dibber in a manner that I never could manage
to imitate. I have found the trowel,
however, do equally well, though it takes up
rather more time.</p>

<p>Another use of transplanting is to remove
trees and shrubs from the nursery to where
they are permanently to remain. To enable
this to be done with safety, the trees and
shrubs in commercial nurseries are prepared
by being always removed every year, or
every other year, whether they are sold or
not. The effect of these frequent removals
is to keep the roots short, and yet provided
with numerous spongioles; for as they are
always pruned on every removal, and as the
effect of pruning is to induce the roots pruned
to send out two short fibrous roots armed
with spongioles, in the place of every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
cut off, the roots, though confined to a small
space, become abundant. The reverse of
this is the case, when plants are left in a natural
state. It has been found, from experience,
that plants imbibe more food than
they absolutely require as nourishment from
the soil, and that they eject part of it; also
that their roots will not reimbibe this excrementitious
matter, but are continually in
search of fresh soil. To provide for this the
fibrous roots are possessed of an extraordinary
power of elongating themselves at their
extremities; and thus the roots of even a
small plant, left to nature, will be found to
extend to a great distance on every side. It
is obvious that this elongation of the roots
must greatly increase the difficulties attending
transplanting. Where the roots extend
to a distance from the tree, a greater extent
of ground has to be disturbed, both to take
up the plant, and to make a pit for replanting
it; the risk of injuring the fibrous roots
is increased; and, as nearly all the spongioles
will require to be cut off, from the
great length of the roots, and consequent
greater difficulty which will attend taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
them up entire, the plant will be nearly
famished before new spongioles can be formed
to supply it with food. All these dangers
are avoided by the nursery system of transplanting;
while the inconvenience of confining
the roots to so small a space is obviated,
by placing the plant, every time it is
transplanted, in fresh soil.</p>

<p>It is customary, when trees or shrubs are
transplanted to the places where they are
permanently to remain, either to make a
puddle for them, or to fix them, as it is
called, with water; the object, in both cases,
being to supply the plant with abundance of
food in its new situation. Care is taken,
also, to make the roots firm in the soil, and
to let the earth penetrate through all their
interstices. To attain these ends, one gardener
generally holds the tree and gently
shakes it, while another is shovelling in the
earth among its roots; but this mode has the
disadvantage of sometimes occasioning the
roots to become matted. When the tree is
to be fixed with water, after a little earth has
been shovelled in over the roots, water is
applied by pouring it from a watering-pot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
held as high as a man can raise it; the watering-pot
used being large, and with a wide
spout, the rose of which must be taken off.
More earth is then shovelled in, and water
applied again. This mode of planting has
the great advantage of rendering the tree
firm, without staking or treading the earth
down round it, as is usually done. Other
gardeners spread the roots out carefully
at the bottom of the hole or pit made
to receive them, and then fill in the earth.
In all cases, the ground is either made firm
with water, or trodden down or beaten flat
with the spade after planting, so as to fix the
roots firmly in the soil, for the same reasons
as nearly a similar plan is adopted in sowing
seeds. Newly transplanted trees are frequently
staked, but this is not essential if the
roots are made firm, and indeed the tree is
generally found to do best when the head is
left at liberty to be gently agitated by the
wind.</p>

<p>It is a great point, in all cases of transplanting,
to preserve the epidermis or cellular
integument of the fibrous roots and spongioles
in a flexible state; and for this reason,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the greatest care is taken to keep them
moist. This is the end in view in puddling
or fixing by water in transplanting; and
many planters always dip the roots of trees
and shrubs in water before replanting. When
a tree or shrub is taken up that is to be conveyed
any distance, the roots should be
wrapped up as soon as it is taken out of the
ground, in wet moss, and covered with bast
matting; and where moss cannot be procured,
they should be dipped in very wet
mud, and then matted up. Cabbage-plants
are frequently preserved in this manner;
and are conveyed, without any other covering
to their roots than a cake of mud, to a
considerable distance. In all cases where
plants are taken up long before they are
replanted, their roots should be kept moist
by opening a trench, and laying the plants
along it, and then covering their roots with
earth. This, gardeners call, laying plants
in by the heels. Where this cannot be
done, and the plants are kept long out of
the ground, their roots should be examined,
and moistened from time to time; and before
replanting they should be laid in water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
for some hours, and afterwards carefully examined,
and the withered and decayed parts
cut off.</p>

<p><i>In removing large trees</i>, care is taken to
prepare the roots by cutting a trench round
the tree for a year or two before removal,
and pruning off all the roots that project
into it. This is to answer the same
purpose as transplanting young trees in a
nursery; while the bad effects of contracting
the range of the roots is counteracted,
by filling the trench with rich fresh
earth. The removal is also conducted with
much care; and either a large ball of earth
is removed with the tree, or the roots are
kept moist, and spread out carefully, at full
length, when the tree is replanted. Some
planters, before removing trees, mark which
side stood to the south, in order to replant
them with the same side turned towards the
sun; and this is sometimes done with young
trees from a nursery. The reason is, that
the tree having generally largest branches,
and being always most flourishing on the
side exposed to the sun; it is thought that
its vegetation might be checked, were a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
side presented to that luminary, by
the efforts it must make to accommodate
itself to its new situation. On the other
hand, however, it may be urged that changing
the position of the plant, particularly
while it is young, will be beneficial in preventing
it from taking any particular bent,
and in promoting the equal distribution of
sap through all the branches.</p>

<p><i>Watering</i> is a most essential branch of culture.
It has been already fully explained
that the seed cannot vegetate, and the plant
cannot grow without water. Carbon, and
all the other substances that form the food of
plants, must be dissolved in water to enable
the spongioles to take them up; and the
spongioles themselves, unless they be kept
moist, will soon lose their power of absorption.
Nothing indeed can be more evident,
even to a common observer, than the necessity
that plants feel for water; if a mimulus
or a pelargonium in a pot, for example, hang
its head and droop its leaves, what an extraordinary
and rapid effect is produced by
giving it water! In an almost incredibly
short time its leaves become firm, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
stem erect; and the plant is not only preserved
from death, but restored to full health
and beauty.</p>

<p>Watering appears an extremely simple
operation, yet nevertheless there are several
points relating to it that it is necessary to attend
to. One of these is, never to saturate
the soil. Water, to be in the best state for
being taken up by the plants, should be kept
in detached globules by the admixture of
air; and it should be only slightly impregnated
with nourishing matter from decaying
animal or vegetable substances: for, as already
observed, when fully saturated with
nourishment, it becomes unfit for the food of
plants. Nothing can be more admirably
and wonderfully adapted for supplying plants
properly with water than rain. In falling
through the atmosphere, it is thoroughly
mixed with the air; and in sinking into the
soil it becomes slightly impregnated with
nutritious qualities, which it is thus enabled
to convey, in the most beneficial manner, to
the plants.</p>

<p>It is a very common mistake, in watering,
to pour the water down close to the stem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the plant. This is injurious in every respect.
Water, when poured profusely on the collar
of the plant, which is the point of junction
between the root and the stem, is likely to
rot, or otherwise seriously injure that vital
part; while the spongioles, which alone can
absorb the water, so as to benefit the plant,
being at the extremity of the roots, are always
as far removed from the stem as the
nature of the plant will allow. Thus, the
distance from the stem at which water should
be given varies in different plants. In those
that have tap-roots, such as the carrot, and
many other culinary vegetables, the lateral
fibrous roots are short, and the spongioles
are comparatively near the stem; but in
trees, and most plants having spreading
roots, the spongioles are generally as far
distant from the stem as the extremity of the
branches; and the water, to be efficacious,
should be given there.</p>

<p><i>The quantity of water to be given</i> varies, not
only according to the nature of the plant,
but to the state of its growth. In spring,
when the sap first begins to be in motion,
and the young plant is every day unfolding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
fresh leaves or blossoms, it requires abundance
of water; as it does when in flower, or
when the fruit is swelling. In autumn, on
the contrary, when the fruit is ripening, and
in winter, when the plant is in a state of
perfect rest, very little water is necessary,
and much is positively injurious, as being
likely either to excite a morbid and unnatural
action in the vessels, or even to bring
on rottenness and decay. Water is necessary
for seeds to induce them to germinate;
but much of it is very injurious to young
plants when they first come up, as it unsettles
their roots, and almost washes them
away. The roots, also, are at first too weak
to imbibe water; and the plants feed on the
nourishment contained in the cotyledons of
the seeds. It is when the second pair of
leaves has opened that water is required,
though it should at first be given sparingly.
When the plant begins to grow vigorously, it
requires more food; and if it be then kept too
short of nourishment, it becomes stunted in
its growth. The quantity of water requisite
also depends on the kind of leaves that the
plant unfolds. A plant with large broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
leaves, like the tobacco, requires twice as
much water as a plant with small pinnate
leaves, like an acacia. Plants exposed to a
strong light, also, require more than plants
grown in the shade.</p>

<p><i>The time for watering plants</i> varies according
to the season. In spring and autumn it
is best to water plants in the morning. But
in summer, the usual time is the evening;
while in winter, the very little that is required,
should be given in the middle of the
day. Many persons object to watering their
plants when the sun is upon them; but this
is not at all injurious, so long as the water is
not too cold, and is only given to the roots.
Watering the leaves when the sun is upon
them will make them blister, and become
covered with pale brown spots wherever the
water has fallen. It is much better to water
plants during sunshine, than to suffer them
to become too dry; as when the spongioles
are once withered, no art can restore them.
When plants have been suffered to become
too dry, the ground should be loosened before
watering it; and water should be given
a little at a time, and frequently, till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
plant appears to have recovered its vigour.
A great deal of the good produced by watering
depends on the state of the ground; as
when the ground is hard and compact, it is
very possible to throw a great quantity of
water upon it without doing any service to
the plants.</p>

<p><i>The kind of water</i> used should also be considered.
The best is pond-water, as it is
always mixed with air, and is, moreover,
generally impregnated with decayed animal
and vegetable matter; and the worst is clear
spring-water, as it is always cold, and is seldom
impregnated with air, or with anything
but some mineral substance, which, so far
from doing good, is positively injurious to
the plants. Rain-water collected in open
cisterns, and river-water, are both very suitable;
and when only spring-water can be
obtained, it should be exposed for some time
to the air before using it. It is always advisable
to have the water at least as warm as
the plants to be watered; and for this reason
the water to be used in hot-houses and
green-houses, is generally kept in an open
vessel in the house some hours before using.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Watering with warm water is very efficacious
in forwarding the flowering of plants.
This was one of the things that was most
repugnant to my prejudices in the course
of my instruction in the art of gardening;
and when Mr. Loudon had some nearly
boiling hot-water poured on some boxes of
hyacinths that I was very anxious to have
brought forward, I could scarcely refrain
from crying out when I saw the steam rising
up from the earth. The hyacinths, however,
so far from being injured, flowered
splendidly; though such is the force of prejudice,
that I could never see the little tin
vessel containing the heated water carried
out to them without a shudder. The effect
of hot-water, not heated to above 200°, in
forwarding bulbs is astonishing; but it must
be observed that it should never be poured
on the bulbs, or on the leaves, but on the
earth near the rim of the pot. Hot water
is also very efficacious in softening seeds with
hard coverings when soaked in it; and some
of the seeds of the New Holland acacias will
not vegetate in this country till they have
been actually boiled.</p>

</div>

<p class="c less sp">MODES OF PROPAGATION BY DIVISION, <i>viz.</i>
TAKING OFF SUCKERS, MAKING LAYERS
AND CUTTINGS, BUDDING, GRAFTING, AND
INARCHING.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Properly</span> speaking, there are only two modes
of propagating plants, viz.: by seed and by
division. The first raises a new individual,
resembling the plant that produced the seed,
as a child does its parent, but not perpetuating
any accidental peculiarity; and the
second method multiplies specimens of the
individual itself. Species are propagated by
seed, and new varieties are raised; but varieties
are generally propagated by division,
as they do not always come true from seed.
Propagation, by division, may be divided
into two kinds:—those in which the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
plants root in the ground, such as suckers,
layers, and cuttings; and those in which they
are made to root in another plant, as in budding,
grafting, and inarching.</p>

<p><i>Suckers.</i>—Sending up suckers, forming
offsets, and throwing out runners, are all
natural ways of propagation that require
very little aid from the hand of man; and if
all plants produced these, nothing more
would be required than to divide the offspring
from the parent, and replant it in any
suitable soil. But only certain plants throw
up suckers, such as the rose, the raspberry,
the lilac, the English elm, &amp;c. Offsets are
only formed on bulbs, and runners are only
thrown out by strawberries, brambles, and a
few other plants; and thus these modes of
propagation are extremely limited in practice.
No plants produce suckers but those
that send out strong horizontal roots; and
the sucker is in fact a bud from one of these
roots which has pushed its way up through
the soil, and become a stem. As this stem
generally forms fibrous roots of its own,
above its point of junction with the parent
root, it may in most cases, when it is thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
necessary to remove it, be slipped off the
parent and planted like a rooted cutting.
As, however, the nourishment it can expect
to derive from its own resources will be at
first much less than what it obtained from its
parent, it is customary, when a sucker is removed,
to cut in its head, to prevent the
evaporation from its leaves being greater than
its roots can supply food for. Sometimes
when the parent is strong, part of the horizontal
root to which the sucker was attached
is cut off and planted with the young
plant.</p>

<p>Suckers of another kind spring up from
the collar of the old plant, and when removed
are always slipped, or cut off, with the fibrous
roots that they may have made, attached.
Offsets are young bulbs which form by the
side of the old one, and merely require
breaking off, and planting in rich light soil.
Runners are shoots springing from the crown
or collar of the plant, which throw out roots
at their joints; and which only require dividing
from the parent plant and replanting in
good soil to make new plants.</p>

<p><i>Layers.</i>—Many plants, when kept in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
moist atmosphere, having a tendency to throw
out roots from their joints, the idea of making
layers must have very early occurred to
gardeners. Where the roots are thrown out
naturally, wherever a joint of the shoot
touches the moist earth, (as is the case with
some of the kinds of verbena, which only require
pegging down to make them form new
plants,) layers differ very little from runners;
but layers, properly so called, are when the
art of the gardener has been employed to
make plants throw out roots when they
would not have done so naturally. The
most common method of doing this is to cut
half through, and slit upwards, a shoot from
a growing plant, putting a bit of twig or potsherd
between the separated parts; and then
to peg down the shoot, so as to bury the
joint nearest to the wound in the earth;
when the returning sap, being arrested in its
progress to the main root, will accumulate at
the joint, to which it will afford such abundance
of nourishment, as to induce it to throw
out a mass of fibrous roots, and to send up a
leading shoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="verbena">
<p class="caption">A Verbena layered.</p>
</div>

<p>The only art required in layering is to
contrive the most effectual means of interrupting
the returning sap, so as to produce as
great an accumulation of it as possible, at the
joint from which the roots are to be produced.
For this purpose, sometimes, instead
of cutting the branch half through, a ring
of bark is taken off, care being taken that
the knife does not penetrate into the wood;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
and at others a wire is twisted firmly round the
shoot, so as to pinch in the bark; or a knife
or any sharp instrument is passed through
the branch several times in different directions:
in short, any thing that wounds, or injures
the shoot, so as to throw an impediment
in the way of the returning sap, and yet not to
prevent the passage of the sap that is ascending,
will suffice.</p>

<p>Layering is a very common mode of propagating
plants: and in nurseries often every
shoot of a tree or shrub is thus wounded and
pegged down. In this case, the central root
is called a stool, from the verb, <i>to stole</i>, which
signifies the power most deciduous trees possess,
of sending up new stems from their
roots when cut down. The seasons for performing
the operation of layering are during
the months of February and March, before
the new sap begins to rise, or in June or
July after all the summer supply of ascending
sap has risen; as at these seasons there is no
danger of injuring the tree by occasioning an
overflow of the ascending sap, which sometimes
takes place when the tree is wounded
while the sap is in active motion. In most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
cases the layers are left on twelve months, and
in many two years, before they are divided
from the parent plant, in order that they may
be sufficiently supplied with roots. In nurseries,
the ground is generally prepared round
each stool by digging, and sometimes by
manuring; and the gardener piques himself
on laying down the branches neatly, so as to
form a radiated circle round the stool, with the
ends rising all round about the same height.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="plant">
</div>

<p><i>Chinese mode of layering.</i>—The Chinese
method of layering, which consists in wounding
a branch, and then surrounding the place
with moist earth contained either in a flower-pot
or a basket, is frequently adopted in the
continental gardens; and it has the very
great advantage of producing a young tree
which will flower and produce fruit while
yet of very small size. It is generally applied
to camellias, orange-trees, and magnolias;
but it will do equally well for almost
any other tree or shrub. When a plant is to
be layered in this manner, a ring of bark is
first taken off, and then a flower-pot is procured,
open on one side, so as to admit the
branch; and some moss being put at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
bottom of the flower-pot, it is filled up with
earth, and a piece of wood is placed inside
the pot before the open part to prevent the
earth from falling out. It may be fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
in its place by wires hung over a branch, or
supported by four little sticks, tied to the
pot with string. The earth should be very
moist before it is put into the pot, and if the
season be dry, it may be re-moistened from
time to time. When the layer is supposed to
have rooted, a cut or rather notch should be
made in the branch below the pot, and afterwards
it may be cut off, and the young plant
transferred with its ball of earth entire to another
pot or the open ground. A simpler way
of performing this operation is using a piece
of lead instead of a flower-pot. A modification
of this plan was adopted by Baron Humboldt
in South America. He provided himself
with strips of pitched cloth, with which he
bound moist earth round the branches of
several of the rare and curious trees he met
with, after first taking off a ring of bark; and
when he returned to the same place some
time after, he found rooted plants which he
brought to Europe.</p>

<p><i>Cuttings</i> differ from layers in being removed
without roots from the parent tree;
and as the current of the ascending sap is
stopped at once by this separation, they generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
require shading, which layers do not;
and also, occasionally, what gardeners call
bottom heat, to induce them to throw out
roots. The branches most suitable for making
cuttings are those which grow nearest to
the ground, especially those which recline on
it, as they have always the greatest tendency
to throw out roots; and the side shoots are
considered preferable to those which grow
erect at the upper part of the plant. The best
season for making cuttings is summer, when
the sap is in full motion; as the returning
sap is then most likely to form the ring or
mass of accumulated matter from which the
new roots are to spring. It has been already
mentioned under the head of layers, that it
is from the joints only that roots can be expected
to grow; and, accordingly, in making
cuttings, the shoot is divided at a joint; and
it is reckoned best to choose the joint at the
point of junction between the young wood
and the wood of the previous season. The
cut should be quite smooth; as if the shoot
be bruised, the returning sap will not be able
to reach the joint in a sufficient quantity to
effect the desired end. Some plants are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
much more difficult to strike as cuttings than
others; but some, such as the willow, the
currant, the vine, &amp;c., will throw out roots
not only from the ring, but from every part
of the stem. These plants do not require so
much care as to cutting off at a joint; and
in fact, will throw out roots from whatever
part may be put into the ground, but even
they succeed best when properly prepared.</p>

<p>The cutting being taken off, and the division
at the joint being made perfectly smooth,
the greater part of the leaves should be cut
off close to the stem, with a sharp knife;
and a hole being made in the soil, the cutting
should be put in, and the earth pressed
close to its extremity, or it will never strike
out roots. This necessity of the part which
is to send out roots being fixed firmly in the
soil, has been already mentioned with regard
to seeds, transplanted trees, and layers; and
this necessity exists with equal or greater
force with regard to cuttings. When these
are made in a pot, the cutting will much
more readily strike (as gardeners call its
throwing out roots), if it rest against the side
of the pot, or even against the bottom.</p>

<p class="caption">A cutting of the <span class="allsmcap">LEMON-SCENTED VERBENA</span> (<i>Aloysia citriodora</i>),<br>

</div>

<p>Cuttings may be struck in the open
ground, and in the common soil, without
any covering; but these cuttings are only of
those plants which strike readily. When
struck in pots, it is customary to fill the pots
half, or entirely full of silver sand, to prevent
the stalk of the cutting from having too
much moisture round it. Those cuttings
which are most liable to be injured by moisture,
such as heaths, &amp;c., are struck in pots
filled entirely with sand; but as there is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>nourishment to be derived from sand, most
cuttings do best with their lower end in
earth, and with only sand about an inch, or
two inches deep, at the top of the pot, to keep
the stem dry, and to prevent it from rotting.
The cutting, when prepared, should be buried
to about the second joint, and two or
three joints with leaves should be left above
the soil. A few leaves to elaborate the sap
in the case of herbaceous plants, or evergreen
trees and shrubs, are essential; for I have
known very promising cuttings of petunias,
which had been some weeks in the ground,
and which had thrown out abundance of
roots, entirely destroyed by some snails
having eaten all the leaves; and I am told
that the case is by no means an uncommon
one. Cuttings of delicate plants are generally
covered with a bulb-glass pressed closely
on the earth, to keep a regular degree of moisture
round the plants, and to prevent too
rapid an evaporation; but I have found cuttings
thus treated very apt to damp off, and
have never succeeded in striking them, unless
I took off the glass to wipe it, every day.
Cuttings of greenhouse plants, I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
told by practical gardeners, strike best
when put into the pots as thickly as possible;
and as they are generally well watered
when first put in the ground, if covered
with a close glass, they will frequently not
require any watering afterwards. As long
as they continue looking fresh, they are
doing well; and as soon as they begin to
grow they should be transplanted into small
thumb pots, and supplied moderately, but
regularly, with water; changing the pots for
larger ones as the plants increase in size, and
according to their nature. Sometimes the
pots are sunk into a hot-bed, to induce the
cuttings to take root, and this is called
applying bottom heat; and sometimes one
flower-pot is placed within another a size
or two larger, and the outer one filled with
water. All these expedients are more or
less efficacious; and the great object with all
of them, is to excite and stimulate the plant.</p>

<p><i>Slips.</i>—When cuttings are made of the
shoots from the root or collar of the plant, or
of little branches stripped off with a small
portion of the root or stem attached, they
are called slips; and they require no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
preparation than cutting off the portion of
bark smooth and close to the shoot. Slips
are generally taken off in March, but they
will also succeed if made in autumn. Cuttings
of succulent plants, such as of the different
kinds of cacti, require to be dried
for some time after they are made, by
placing them on a shelf in the sun. This is
done to prevent a waste of the returning
sap; which, in plants of this kind, is very
abundant, and in a very liquid state.</p>

<p class="caption">A piping of a Carnation.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Pipings</i> are cuttings of
pinks and carnations, and
indeed are applicable to all
plants having jointed tubular
stems. They are prepared
by taking a shoot
that has nearly done growing,
and holding the root
end of it in one hand, below
a pair of leaves, and
with the other pulling the
top part above the pair of
leaves, so as to separate it
from the root-part of the
stem at the socket formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
by the axils of the leaves, leaving the part of
the stem pulled off with a tubular or pipe-like
termination. Hence the name of pipings;
and when thus separated, they are inserted in
finely sifted earth or sand, and a hand-glass
is fixed firmly over them. Most florists cut
off the tips of the leaves of pipings, but
others plant them entire; and the pipings
grow apparently equally well under both
modes of treatment.</p>

<p><i>The principal points to be attended to
making cuttings</i> are, to cut off the shoot at
a joint, without bruising the stem; to make
the cutting at a time when the sap is in
motion; to fix the end which is to send out
roots, firmly in the soil; to keep it in an
equal temperature both as regards heat and
moisture; to cut off part of the leaves, and
to shade the whole, so as to prevent too
much evaporation, without excluding the
light, which is wanted to stimulate the
plant; to keep the soil moist, but not too
damp; and to pot off the young plants as
soon as they begin to grow.</p>

<p><i>Budding</i> has been compared to sowing a
seed; but it may rather be considered as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
making a cutting with a single eye, and inserting
it in another tree, called the stock, instead
of in the ground. A young shoot of
the current year’s wood is cut off in the latter
end of July or August, or perhaps, if the
season should be very moist, the first week
in September; and incisions are made longitudinally
and across, on each side, above
and below a bud, so that the bud may be
cut out, attached to an oblong piece of wood
and bark, pointed at the lower end. The
leaf is then taken off, but the footstalk is
left on.</p>

<p>The next thing is to separate the bark
with the bud attached from the wood; and
on the nicety of this operation much depends,
as if any wood be left in the bark the
bud will not take; generally, however, if the
sap is in a proper state of movement, the
wood comes out easily, without leaving the
smallest particle behind. The bud must be
then examined below, that is, on the side
that was next the wood; and if it appears
fresh and firm it is likely to take, but if it
looks shrunk and withered it had better be
thrown away, as it will never grow. Slits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
longitudinal and across are then made in a
shoot of the stock, generally near the fork of
a branch; and the bark is gently raised by
the handle of the budding knife, which is
purposely made thin and flat, while the piece
of bark to which the bud is attached is slipped
into the opening, and the bark of the
stock closed over it. This is an operation
that requires the greatest nicety and exactness;
as unless the inner bark of the bud fits
quite closely to the soft wood of the stock, it
is in vain to hope that it will take. The
operation is then completed by binding the
two parts together with a strand or strip of
bast mat, which in the case of rose trees is
quite sufficient; but buds on apple and pear
trees are sometimes wrapped round with wet
moss, which is tied on by shreds of bast
matting. In all cases, the strips of bast
should be left long enough to be tied with
bows and ends, that the ligature may be
loosened and tied again without deranging
the position of the bud as soon as it begins
to grow. The first sign of the bud having
taken, as it is called, is when the petiole of
the leaf (that was left on when the leaf itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
was cut off,) drops, on being very slightly
touched with the finger; but the ligature
should not be loosened till the bud begins to
throw out leaves; and then it should be re-tied
only a little slacker than before, until the
bud is firmly united with the stock.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="budding">
<p class="caption">Mode of budding a Rose-tree.</p>
</div>

<p>Budding, though sometimes used for apples
and pears, when the spring grafts have
failed, is most commonly applied to roses: it
is, however, occasionally used for inserting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
eyes in the tubers of the dahlia. It sometimes
happens that a large portion of a
dahlia-root is found to be entirely devoid of
buds, or as the gardeners call them, eyes;
and when this is the case, in whatever soil
the root may be planted, it will never send
up a stem. Other dahlia tubers, on the
contrary, may be found full of buds; and
when this is the case, one of them is scooped
out, and a corresponding hole being made in
the barren tuber to receive it, the bud is
fitted in, and the point of junction covered
with grafting wax. The tuber must then be
planted in a pot with the budded part above
the soil; and the pot plunged into a hot-bed
till the bud begins to push, when the tuber
may be planted out into the open ground.</p>

<p>What is called flute-grafting, is in fact, a
kind of budding; as it consists in taking a
ring of bark, on which there is a bud, off a
shoot; and then supplying its place with a
ring of bark, with a bud attached, from
another tree: placing the suppositious bud
as nearly as possible in the position of the
true bud. Sometimes, however, this is not
thought necessary; and the ring of bark is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
taken from any part of the stock;
though it is always replaced by a
ring of bark containing a bud from
the scion. There are many other
kinds of budding, but as the principles
are the same in all, it is not
necessary to detail them here. The
blade of the budding knife should
curve outwards, to lessen the danger
of wounding the wood when
making the incisions.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="budding">
</div>

<p><i>The principal points to be attended
to in budding</i>, are; to choose a fresh
healthy bud; to separate the bark
to which it is attached without
wounding it, quite cleanly from the
wood; to make a clear incision
through the bark of the stock, and
to raise it without wounding it from
the wood; to press the bark containing
the bud, closely to the wood
of the stock so that no air can remain
between them; and to perform
the operation in moist weather,
not earlier than the last week in
July, nor later than the first week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
in September. Of these points the most
important are the joining closely the bark of
the bud to the wood of the stock, and the
performing the operation in moist, or at
least in cloudy weather; and if these are attended
to there is little doubt of success.
When the young shoot begins to grow, it is
usual to shorten the branches of the stock,
so as to throw the whole vigour of the tree
into the bud. It is singular to observe that
even when the operation is most successful,
no intimate union takes place between the
bud and the stock: they grow firmly together,
but they do not incorporate, and the point
of union may always be distinctly traced.</p>

<p>It must always be remembered that a
plant can only be budded on another plant
of the same nature as itself; thus a peach
may be budded on a plum, as they are both
stone fruits, and both belong to the same
section of the natural order Rosaceæ; but a
peach can neither be budded on a walnut,
which belongs to another natural order, nor
even on an apple or a pear, both of which,
though belonging to the order Rosaceæ, are
kerneled fruits, and are included in another
section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p><i>Grafting</i> differs from budding in its being
the transfer of a shoot with several buds on
it, from one tree to another, instead of only
a single bud; and as budding has been compared
to sowing seeds, so has grafting to
making cuttings. The art of grafting consists
in bringing two portions of growing shoots
together, so that the liber, or soft wood of two
may unite and grow together; and the same
general principles apply to it as to budding.
There are above fifty modes of grafting described
in books, but only three or four are
in common use.</p>

<p>In all kinds of grafting the shoot to be
transferred is called the scion, and the tree
that is to receive it is called the stock; and
it is always desirable, not only that the kinds
to be united should be of the same genus, or
at least of the same natural family, but that
they should agree as closely as possible in
their time of leafing, in the duration of their
leaves, and in their habits of growth. This
is conformable to common sense; as it is
quite obvious that unless the root send up a
supply of sap at the time the leaves want it,
and only then, the graft must suffer either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
from famine or repletion. For this reason, a
deciduous plant cannot be grafted on an evergreen,
and the reverse. The necessity of a
conformity in the habit of growth, is strikingly
displayed in Mr. Loudon’s <i>Arboretum
Britannicum</i>, in a flowering ash grafted
on a common ash; by which it is shown,
that an architectural column with its plinth
and capital may be formed in a living tree,
where there is a decided difference in the
growth of the stock and the scion.</p>

<p>These examples show that no intimate
union takes place between the scion and the
stock; and the fact is, that though they
grow together and draw their nourishment
from the same root, they are in every other
respect perfectly distinct. The stock will
bear its own leaves, flowers, and fruit, on
the part below the graft; while the scion is
bearing its leaves, flowers, and fruit which
are widely different, on the part above the
graft. Nay, five or six grafts of different
species on the same tree, will each bear a
different kind of fruit at the same time. This
want of amalgamation between the scion and
the stock is particularly visible in cases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
severe frost, when the former is more tender
than the latter; as the graft is frequently
killed without the stock being injured. It is
also necessary when grafted trees are for any
reason cut down, to leave a portion above
the graft for the new shoots to spring from;
as otherwise the proprietor will find his trees
changed as if by magic, and instead of choice
kinds only the common sorts left. A rather
droll instance of this happened some years
ago, in the neighbourhood of London; an
ignorant gardener having a conservatory full
of very choice Camellias, and wishing to
reduce the plants to a more compact shape,
cut them down for that purpose; when in
due time he found, to his great confusion
and dismay, that the choice Camellias had
all vanished, and that he had nothing left
but a number of plants of the common single
red on which they had been grafted.</p>

<p><i>The proper season for grafting</i> is in spring,
generally in March and April; in order that
the union between the scion and the stock
may be effected when the sap is in full
vigour. At this season a stock is chosen
of nearly the same diameter as the scion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
whether that stock be a young tree, or merely
a branch; and they are both cut so as to
fit each other. One piece is then fitted on
the other as exactly as possible; and if practicable,
it is contrived that the different
parts, such as the bark, soft wood, and hard
wood of the one, may rest on the corresponding
parts of the other; and on the exactness
with which this is done, the neatness of appearance
in the graft depends. It is not,
however, essential to the success of the
operation that all the parts of the scion
should fit exactly on the corresponding parts
of the stock, or even that the two trees
should be of the same diameter, for if the
bark and the soft wood correspond in any
one point so as to unite, it is sufficient to
make the graft take. As soon as the scion
and the stock are properly fitted to each
other, the parts are neatly bound together
with a strand of bast mat steeped in water to
make it flexible; and the bast is covered
with a composition called grafting clay,
which is put on to keep the absorbent vessels
of the wounded parts moist, and capable
of the alternate contractions and dilations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
which will be necessary during the passage
of the ascending and returning sap between
the stock and the graft. These directions
apply alike to all kinds of grafting; and the
difference between the sorts refers principally
to the manner in which the corresponding
parts are cut to fit each other.</p>

<p><i>Whip or Tongue Grafting</i> is where both
the stock and the scion are cut in a slanting
direction so as to fit each other, and a little
slit is made in the stock into which a tongue
or projecting part cut in the scion fits.
The head of the scion is then cut off in a
slanting direction, slanting upwards from the
part cut to receive the scion, and the two
are bound closely together with a strand of
bast mat, or wrapped in moss, and then covered
with grafting clay. The part left on
the stock in a slanting direction above the
graft withers, and is cut off when the graft
has taken. This is the kind of grafting generally
practised in nurseries, and it is the
most useful, as it does not require the scion
and the stock to be of the same size.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" alt="whip">
<p class="caption">The common mode of Whip or Tongue Grafting.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Peg Grafting</i> is an old method seldom
practised now; according to it, the bark at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the extremity of the scion is cut through,
and the central wood shaped like a peg; a
hole is then bored in the stock to receive the
scion, and when the one is inserted in the
other, the bark of the two is brought together,
so as to make but a very slight scar.</p>

<p><i>Cleft Grafting</i> is where the scion is shaped
at the extremity like a wedge, and a cleft is
made in the stock to receive it. When this
kind of grafting is practised with trees and
shrubs, the head of the stock is cut off; but
a modification of it is practised with succulent
plants, in which the end of the graft
having been cut into the shape of a wedge,
is inserted into a cleft made in the side of
the stock to receive it, and the line of junction
is covered with grafting wax. The
tubers of strong common dahlias may be
grafted in the cleft manner with choice sorts,
as may the tubers of the herbaceous pæonies
with scions of the tree-pæony. This last is
very useful, as cuttings of the Pæonia Moutan
remain weak for several years, while
roots grafted in July or August will flower
the following spring.</p>

<p><i>Crown Grafting</i> resembles the last kind in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
requiring the head of the stock to be cut off,
but the scion is shaped at the extremity like
a wedge flattened on one side, and it is
pushed in between the bark and wood of the
stock, with its flat side next the wood, till it
is stopped by a shoulder with which it is
provided to prevent it going in too far. In
<i>Saddle Grafting</i> the head of the stock is cut
off, and the extremity of the trunk is shaped
like a long wedge; a long slit is then made
in the scion, and the divided parts are made
to stand astride on the stock. The bark is
then pared off at the extremity, so that the
two parts may fit quite close; and a firm
ligature is applied.</p>

<p><i>Herbaceous Grafting</i> is very badly named,
as it gives the idea of its being a kind
of grafting applied to herbaceous plants;
whereas, in fact, it only means grafting with
the brittle wood of the current year, in
opposition to common grafting, which is
always performed with firm wood, frequently
of several years’ growth. Herbaceous grafting
is now generally used for trees of the
pine and fir tribe, which, only a few years
ago, it was thought impossible to graft at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
The proper time for this kind of grafting is
when the young pine-shoots have made
about three parts of their growth, and are
still so herbaceous as to break readily between
the fingers, like a shoot of asparagus. The
shoot of the stock is then broken off about
two inches below the point, and all the
leaves stripped off for nearly two inches
more, except two sheaths of leaves, which
are left, one on each side, close to the top.
The shoot is then split with a very thin
knife between the sheaths of leaves left on,
and the scion, having had its lower extremity
prepared by stripping off the leaves, and
cutting it into the shape of a wedge, is
inserted as in cleft grafting, and the parts
are bound together with list, or with a strip
of thin woollen cloth. A cone of paper is
then put over the whole to protect it from
the sun and rain, and the graft is very
seldom found to fail. Sometimes this kind
of grafting is applied to annual plants. The
period chosen should be when the plant is in
its greatest vigour, and is just going into
flower. The flower stem is then cut off
close to a leaf, and a slit is made in the stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
downwards. The scion is then taken off
near the root of the plant, and the end
being cut into a wedge-shape, is inserted in
the slit. The wound is then bound up with
strips of cloth spread with grafting wax, and
the leaf taken great care of. When the
graft begins to grow, this leaf and all the
shoots below it are removed. In this manner
artichokes have been grafted on cardoons,
and cauliflowers on cabbages with great
success. Tomatoes have also been grafted
on potatoes in this manner, the potatoes
perfecting their tubers, and the tomatoes
their fruit, at the same time; and it is said
that the ripening of the latter was much
accelerated. This mode of grafting was
invented by the Baron Tschoudy, a gentleman
residing at Metz, and the principal
point in it which requires attention, is the
preserving a leaf, or two leaves, at the extremity
of the stock, to serve as nurses to
the graft.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="stock">
<p class="caption">Stock and Scion prepared for Inarching.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Inarching, or Grafting by Approach.</i>—Though
I have left this till last, it is in fact
the most simple of all ways of grafting, and
it is certainly the only one practised by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>nature. In a natural forest, two branches
rub against each other in windy weather, till
the bark of both becomes wounded; a calm
ensues, and, while it lasts, the wounded
branches lying across each other adhere and
grow together. Of this, which is called inosculation,
examples in the beech, the hornbeam,
and the oak, are given in Mr. Loudon’s
<i>Arb. Brit.</i>; and it is probable that mankind derived
the first idea of grafting from observing
instances of this kind. Inarching, as practised
in nurseries, closely resembles layering.
A branch is bent and partly cut through,
and the heel thus formed is slipped into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
slit made downwards in the stock to receive
it. The parts are then made to meet as
exactly as possible, and are bound together
with bast mat, and covered with grafting
clay, as in common grafting. In five or six
months the union will be complete; and the
inarched plant will be ready to be separated
from the parent, which is done with a very
sharp knife, so as to leave a clean cut, and
not a bruised one. The head of the stock,
if it was left on when the plant was inarched,
is then cut away, and the plant is ready for
removal. It is, however, customary to keep
on the grafting clay and ligature for a few
weeks, till the plant is firmly established.
This mode of propagation is very commonly
practised with Camellias and Magnolias;
and it is usual in nurseries to see a fine new
kind of Camellia surrounded by a sort of
frame, on which are several pots of stocks of
the single red, placed at different heights for
the convenience of attaching to them different
branches of the choice kind, to undergo the
process of inarching. In most of these cases
the head of the stock is retained, and the
scion introduced at the side; but as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the graft has taken, and has thrown out a
sufficient number of leaves to carry on the
elaboration of the sap, all the branches of the
original plant above the graft are cut away
to strengthen the inarched one.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="camellia">
<p class="caption">Mode of inarching the Camellia.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Grafting clay and grafting wax</i> have been
so frequently mentioned in the various operations
of grafting and budding, that it
seems necessary to say a few words on their
composition. Common grafting clay is made
with any kind of stiff clay mixed with a
fourth part of fresh horse-dung free from
litter, and a portion of cut hay; a little
water is sprinkled on the mass, and the
whole is beaten several times a day for a
week together, till the ingredients are thoroughly
amalgamated. The common French
grafting clay, or Onguent de Ste Fiacre, is
composed of equal parts of stiff clay and
cow-dung; but a superior kind, recommended
by M. De Candolle, is composed of
one pound of cow-dung, half a pound of
pitch, and half a pound of yellow wax.
Grafting wax is generally made of equal
parts of turpentine, bees’-wax, and resin,
with a little tallow, melted together, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
thoroughly incorporated. This is thinly
spread on cotton cloth, and used in strips
like cerecloth. In grafting trees with soft
and delicate bark, fine moss and cotton wool
tied on with ligatures of bast mat, are better
than anything else, and they are quite sufficient
for every purpose for which grafting
clay can be required for ladies. A new
composition has been lately invented, made
with caoutchouc, which is said to be very
efficacious, but I have never seen it tried.</p>

<p><i>The essential points to be attended to in
grafting</i> are choosing a stock and a scion
that correspond in nature and in habits of
growth; cutting the parts to be united so as
to fit exactly and leave no vacuity between;
taking care that the soft wood of the scion
shall always rest on the soft wood of the
stock, as it is between these parts that the
union is to be effected; binding the parts
closely together, and covering them so as to
prevent them from becoming so dry as to
shrink apart, in which case the vessels would
wither and become incapable of uniting.</p>

<p><i>Uses of Grafting and Budding.</i> The obvious
use of grafting is to propagate varieties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
that cannot so easily be continued by seed,
and that will not strike by cuttings. There
is, however, another use nearly as important;
and this is to make plants flower and fruit
sooner than they would otherwise do. There
are many plants that only flower at the extremity
of their shoots; and these plants,
when tender, would require enormous plant-houses
before they would be thrown into
flower or fruit. To remedy this inconvenience,
a method has been devised of cutting
off the tips of the shoots and grafting them;
and then, after they have grown for some
time, cutting off the tips again and regrafting
them, by means of which flowers are at
length produced on plants of quite a small
size. The same method is applied in Paris
to rare fruit-trees to throw them into fruit;
and it has been tried with success with the
rose-apple (Eugenia Jambos), the mango,
&amp;c. In common nurseries, the fruit of new
seedling apples is obtained much sooner by
grafting than by leaving the plant to nature;
and this plan is also practised at Brussels by
Prof. Van Mons, to test his seedling-pears.</p>

<p class="c less sp">PRUNING, TRAINING, PROTECTING FROM FROST,<br>
AND DESTROYING INSECTS.</p>


<p><i>Pruning</i> appears, at first sight, a most laborious
and unfeminine occupation; and
yet perhaps there is no operation of gardening
which a lady may more easily accomplish.
With the aid of a small, and almost
elegant pair of pruning shears, which I procured
from Mr. Forrest, of Kensington
Nursery, I have myself (though few women
have less strength of wrist) divided branches
that a strong man could scarcely cut through
with a knife. The only thing to be attended
to is to choose a pair of pruning
shears with a sliding joint, so as to make
what is called a draw-cut; in order that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
branch may be divided by a clean cut, and
not bruised on the side next the plant, and
also to leave a somewhat sloping section.
When a branch is pruned, it should also be
cut as near to a bud as can be done without
injuring the bud itself; or, to speak more
definitely, not more in length than the
branch is thick should be left beyond the
bud. The cut should slope downwards
from the bud to prevent the water lodging
in the angle; and also that the sun and air
may have their full influence in exciting the
bark to cover the wound. When a long
piece of branch, or what gardeners call a
snag, is left beyond the bud, it withers, from
there being no leaves beyond it to carry on
the circulation of the sap; and it thus not
only becomes a deformity, but very often
seriously injures the tree by rotting, and
infecting the fruit-bearing branch to which
it is attached.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="pruning">
</div>

<p>According to the usual method of pruning
with a knife, the gardener holds the branch
in his left hand, below the part that is to be
removed; and then, holding the knife firmly
with the thumb at the back of the blade, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>makes a strong cut upwards, and
from him, so as to remove the
branch with a single stroke, and
to leave a slanting section. This
operation, however, requiring
strength as well as skill, it will
generally be safer for a lady to
keep to her pruning shears, a
pair of which may be bought for
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and which will be sufficient
to cut through the largest
branch that a lady would be able
to remove; or to use a pair of
garden scissors fixed to a pole
which may be lengthened or
taken to pieces like a fishing-rod.
The scissors are strong and sharp,
and are made to act by means of
a long cord, which passes through
rings down the side of the pole.
The principal use of these scissors
is to remove dead roses, &amp;c., but
they will also cut off a branch of
dead wood, &amp;c. When a gardener
wishes to remove a large
branch, he first cuts a notch out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of it on each side, and then with his pruning
knife, or a small saw, he divides the diminished
space. In all cases, the great art
of pruning consists in making a clean sharp
cut, so as to leave the bark in a healthy
state to make an effort to cover over the
wound, and in pruning sufficiently near a
bud not to leave any dead wood.</p>

<p><i>The time for pruning</i> is either early in
spring, after all danger is over from frost,
but before the sap has begun to move; or in
winter, after the movement of the sap for the
summer has ceased. Summer pruning is
also necessary with some trees; but, generally
speaking, it should be confined to
rubbing off all buds which would produce
unnecessary shoots, as soon as they appear.
This operation is called disbudding, and it is
highly efficacious in sparing the strength of
the tree. The points of those shoots which
appear to be running too much to wood,
should also be pinched off; or every leaf
may be taken off them as it appears, which
will exhaust the superfluous strength of the
tree; and the shoots which will produce no
buds for want of leaves, may be removed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the winter pruning. The vine is very apt to
bleed when pruning has been delayed too
late; and in very strong vigorous plants, the
ascending sap sometimes drops from the
branches like rain. The French very poetically
call these drops the tears of the vine.</p>

<p><i>The uses to which pruning is applied</i> are
various; but most commonly it is intended
either to improve the form of the tree, or to
make it bear more flowers and fruit than it
otherwise would do: it is also used for removing
diseased or broken branches; and,
in cases of transplanting, for proportioning
the head to the roots.</p>

<p><i>Pruning to improve the form</i> of a tree in
pleasure-grounds, is only required in those
cases where trees have grown under unfavourable
circumstances, and where they have
been too much drawn up, or distorted in any
manner: but in useful plantations it is necessary
to prepare trees for the purposes for
which they are intended. Thus, for example,
a tree intended for timber, should have
its side-branches taken off while they are
quite young, in order that the wounds may
soon heal over, and not leave loose knots to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
weaken or disfigure the wood; while a tree
intended for a screen should be allowed
ample space for its branches to spread from
the ground upwards, and then they should
only be shortened at their extremities, to
make them throw out short branches near
the tree. In pleasure-grounds the principal
object is generally either to preserve the
shape of the tree or shrub, so that it may
form an agreeable object on a lawn; or to
let it combine in a group with others, either
for ornament, or to serve as a screen or
shelter. In the first case, it is obvious that
no pruning is requisite, but to remove dead,
diseased, or unsightly branches; and in the
second, the pruning must depend upon the
shape the tree is required to take to group
well with the others planted near it.</p>

<p><i>Pruning to produce flowers or fruit</i> has in
view two objects: first, to cut off all superfluous
wood, so as to throw the strength of
the tree into the fruit-bearing branches; and
secondly, to admit the sun and air into the
interior of the tree to ripen and strengthen
the wood. In both cases the attention of
the pruner must be directed to thinning out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
weak and crowded shoots; and to keeping
both the sides of the tree well balanced, in
order that the circulation of the sap may be
equal throughout. This will preserve the
general health of the tree, at the same time
that it throws the sap into the proper channels;
and the fruit will be produced in as
much abundance as can be done without
injuring the tree. It should never be forgotten,
that to effect permanent improvements,
nature should be aided, not over-strained;
and that all extraordinary exertions
are succeeded by a period of feebleness and
languor; or, if the exertion be continued too
long, by death. Thus, all cases of pruning
and training to produce fruit, should never
be pushed too far: as though, by occasioning
an extraordinary deposit of the returning sap
in some particular part, that part may be
forced into fruit, the unnatural deposit cannot
fail in the end to engender disease.</p>

<p>Sometimes a tree, from being supplied
with more food than it can digest, or from
some other cause, has a tendency to produce
what the English gardeners call water-shoots,
and which the French call gourmands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
These are strong, vigorous-growing branches,
which are sent up from the main trunk of
the tree, but which do not produce either
flowers or fruit; and which, consequently, if
the tree be full of wood, should be removed
as soon as their true character is discovered.
If, however, the tree have too little wood in
the centre, or if it appear exhausted by too
much bearing, these branches should be
spared, as they will serve admirably both to
fill up any blanks that may have been left in
the training, and to strengthen the trunks
and roots by the quantity of rich returning
sap, which they will send down from their
numerous leaves. A certain quantity of
leaves and barren branches are essential to
the health of every tree; and the fruit-grower
who consults his own interest, should
cherish them instead of grudging the sap
required for their support. Whenever there
is not a sufficient quantity of leaves to elaborate
the sap, the fruit that ought to have
been nourished by its rich juices, becomes
flaccid and insipid; its skin grows tough
instead of crisp; and if the deprivation of
leaves has been carried to excess, the fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
never ripens, but withers prematurely, and
falls off. Pruning, at the best, is a violent
remedy; and, like all other violent remedies,
if carried further than is absolutely necessary,
it generally ends by destroying.</p>

<p><i>Training</i> is intimately connected with
pruning, and like it should always be used
with caution. A trained tree is a most
unnatural object; and whatever care may be
taken of it, there can be no doubt that training
shortens its life by many years. The
principal object of training is to produce
from a certain number of branches a greater
quantity of fruit or flowers than would grow
on them if the plant were left in a natural
state; and this is effected by spreading and
bending the branches, so as to form numerous
depositions of the returning sap, aided, where
the plant is trained against the wall, by the
shelter and reflected heat which the wall
affords. Thus the points to be attended to
by the gardener in training are the covering
of the wall, so that no part of it may be lost;
the bending of the branches backwards and
forwards, so that they may form numerous
deposits of the returning sap; and the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
exposure of the fruit-bearing branches to the
sun and air. For these purposes the gardener
shortens the long shoots, to make them throw
out side-branches, with which he covers his
walls, never suffering them to cross each
other, but letting each be as much exposed
to the influence of the air and light as is
consistent with a necessary quantity of leaves;
and he bends them in different directions to
throw them into fruit. These general principles
are common to all fruit-trees, but of
course they must be modified to suit the
habits of the different kinds. Thus, for
example, some trees, such as the fig and the
pomegranate, only bear on the extremities of
their shoots; and, consequently, if their shoots
were continually shortened, these trees would
never bear at all; other trees, such as the
apple and the pear, bear their fruit on short
projecting branches, called spurs; and others
at intervals on nearly all the branches, and
close to the wall. All these habits should be
known to the gardener, and the modes of
training adopted which will be suitable to
each. Training flowers should also be regulated
by a knowledge of the habits of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
plants; but it consists principally in checking
their over-luxuriance of growth, and tying
them to stakes or wooden frames. In all
kinds of training, neatness is essentially requisite,
and any departure from it is exceedingly
offensive. Where the hand of art is so
evident as it is in training, we require excessive
neatness to make us amends for the loss
of the graceful luxuriance of nature.</p>

<p><i>The operation of training against a wall</i> is
performed by the aid of nails and shreds;
the shreds being narrow oblong pieces of list
or cloth, put round the branches, and attached
to the wall by nails driven in with a hammer.
Care should be taken that the pieces of list
are long enough to allow of the free passage
of the sap, and yet not so long as to permit
the branch to be so agitated by the wind as
to bruise itself against the wall. The nails
should also never be driven in so as to wound
or corrode the bark; and when driving in
the nails, the gardener should be very careful
not to bruise the branch with his hammer.
The shreds should be broad enough not to
cut the bark, and yet not so broad as to
cover the buds; and they should, as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
as possible, be of some uniform and dark
colour. As few shreds should be used as are
sufficient to attain the end in view; but
these should be very firmly attached, as nothing
gives a more gloomy picture of misery
and desolation in a garden, than trees that
once were trained, having become detached,
and hanging drooping from the wall. Sometimes
wires are fastened to walls, to which
the plants are tied with strands of bast mat;
the strand, after it is put round the branch,
and the wire being gently twisted between the
finger and thumb, in order that it may make
a firm knot without tearing or weakening the
ligament. Climbing shrubs are tied to the
pillars of a verandah, or to trellis work, in
the same manner; as are also flowers to
sticks, or slight wooden or wire frames, with
the exception that, in their case, the bast
does not require twisting.</p>

<p><i>Protecting from frost</i> is an essential part of
culture to a lady gardener, particularly in so
uncertain a climate as that of England. Not
only the blossoms of peaches and nectarines,
and those of other early flowering fruit-trees,
are liable to be injured by the spring frosts;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
but those of the tree pæony, and other beautiful
shrubs, are frequently destroyed by
them; and, unfortunately, many of the
modes of protection, by knocking off and
bruising the blossoms, are almost as injurious
as the frosts that they are intended to guard
against. Twisting a straw-rope round the
trunk of the tree, and putting its ends into a
bucket of water, is certainly a simple method,
and it has been recommended as a very efficacious
one. When a mat is used to protect
wall trees, it does perhaps least injury to the
blossoms, when curtain rings are sewed to its
upper end, and it is hung by these on hold-fasts,
or large hooks, driven into the upper
part of the wall. To make it more secure, particularly
in windy weather, it may be tied on
the sides with bast to nails driven into the wall;
and a broad moveable wooden coping should
rest on the hold-fasts, and cover the space
between the mat and the wall, to prevent
injury from what are called perpendicular
frosts. Camellias and many half-hardy
shrubs may be protected by laying straw or
litter round the roots; as the severest frosts
seldom penetrate more than a few inches into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the ground. Even in the severe winter of
1837-8, the ground was not frozen at the
depth of ten inches. Tree pæonies, and other
tender shrubs, that are in a growing state,
very early in the spring, may be protected
by coverings of basket work, which are sufficiently
large and light to be lifted off in fine
days. Hand and bell glasses, sea-kale pots,
and wooden frames covered with oiled paper
are all useful for protecting small plants.</p>

<p><i>Insects, and Snails and Slugs</i> are the terror
of all gardeners; and the destruction they
effect in some seasons in small gardens is
almost beyond the bounds of credibility.
Birds do comparatively little injury, and indeed
all the soft-billed kinds (which fortunately
include most of the sweetest songsters)
do good. The willow and common wrens,
the blackcap, the nightingale, the redstart,
all the warblers and fly-catchers, the swallows
and martins, the wagtails, the wryneck,
the tomtit, the fern owl or night jar, and
many others, live almost entirely on insects,
and destroy great numbers every year: while
the blackbird and the thrush, the robin and
the sparrows, though they devour a portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
of the fruit, destroy insects also. All birds
may indeed be safely encouraged in small
gardens near towns, as they will do much
more good than injury; and a few cherries
and currants are a cheap price to pay for
their delightful songs.</p>

<p>As it is the larvæ only of insects, with very
few exceptions, that do injury to vegetation,
many persons never think of destroying
them in any other state; forgetting that
every butterfly that we see fluttering about
may lay thousands of eggs, and that if we
wait till these eggs have become caterpillars,
irreparable mischief will be done to our
plants before they can possibly be destroyed.
Whenever a butterfly is seen quietly sitting
on the branch of a tree, in the daytime, it
will generally be found to be a female, that
either just has laid, or what is more probable,
is just about to lay her eggs. As soon
as the eggs are laid, the butterfly generally
dies; and where dead butterflies are found,
search should always be made for their eggs.
In summer, a little oblong chrysalis, the
colour of which is yellow, with black bands,
will frequently be found hanging from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
gooseberry-bushes; and whenever it is seen
it should be destroyed. This chrysalis is
the pupa of the magpie moth, the caterpillar
of which frequently strips the gooseberry-bushes
of all their leaves in spring, and thus
renders their fruit worthless in summer. The
lackey caterpillar is another very destructive
insect. These creatures, which are curiously
striped, like the tags on a footman’s shoulder,
(whence their name,) assemble together in
great numbers, and covering themselves with
a web, completely devour the epidermis and
parenchyma of the leaf on which they have
fixed themselves; they then draw another
leaf to them, which they also devour, and
then another, till the greater part of the
leaves of the tree they have attacked, present
a fine lace-like appearance, as though
they had been macerated. Did all these
insects live to become moths, they would
completely destroy not only our gardens,
but our forests, as they feed on almost every
different kind of tree; but with that beautiful
arrangement by which all the works of
our Great Creator are balanced equally with
each other, and none allowed to predominate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
these insects are such favourite food for
birds, that not a hundredth part of them are
suffered to reach maturity. The eggs of the
lackey moth are often found fixed on a naked
twig, in winter, looking like a bracelet
of hard beads, and adhering so firmly together,
that the whole bracelet may be slipped
off entire.</p>

<p>The cabbage butterflies are also very destructive
in the larva state. The caterpillars
are soft, of a pale whitish green, and very
active, leaping about in the hand when
taken; and the chrysalis, which is also green,
looks as if it were swathed up like a mummy.
The caterpillar of the beautiful little
ermine moth is a gregarious feeder, like the
lackey caterpillar, and is nearly as destructive;
and it is the more necessary to mention
this, because the moth itself is so small,
so delicate, and so quiet, that no one unacquainted
with its habits would think of killing
it as an injurious insect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig16.jpg" alt="blower">
<p class="caption">Patent Blower and Fumigator.</p>
</div>

<p>The leaf-rollers, the saw-flies, and the
gnats which occasion the oak-galls, are all
very destructive. The leaves of the rose-tree
are often found marked, in summer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
with pale-brown zigzag lines, with a narrow
black line running down the middle of each.
These lines are the work of a very small
orange-coloured caterpillar, not more than
two lines long, that lives on the parenchyma
of the leaf; and the pale-brown mark is
occasioned by the epidermis drying where
the pulp beneath it has been removed. The
moth is called the red-headed pigmy, and it
is so small as not to measure more than two
lines and a half broad, when its wings are
fully expanded. The “worm i’ th’ bud” of
the rose, is the maggot or grub of one of the
kinds of saw-fly; a beautiful transparent-winged
little creature that no one would
suspect of springing from such a frightful-looking
maggot. But of all the insects that
infest the rose, the most destructive are the
aphides. These little green flies cover the
tender leaves and buds of the young shoots
in myriads, and are extremely difficult to
destroy, without spoiling the appearance of
the shoots that have been attacked by them.
Tobacco-water is an excellent remedy, if not
too strong. It should be made by steeping
half-a-pound of the best tobacco in a gallon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
of hot water; and as soon as the infusion
has become cold, the young shoots should
be dipped in it, and suffered to remain a few
seconds, after which they should be immediately
washed in clean water before they
are suffered to dry. If this be done carefully,
the insects will be destroyed, and yet
the shoots will remain uninjured. Limewater
may also be tried, if no more lime be
used than the water will hold in solution; as
unless the water be quite clear in appearance
when applied, the plant will be very
much disfigured with the white stains of the
lime. Another means of getting rid of all
noxious insects, is to fumigate them with
tobacco; and the best way of doing this is
by a small brass fumigator, which costs four
shillings, applied to one of Clark’s patent
blowers. The fumigator is filled with loose
tobacco, which is lighted, and the brass tube
is then screwed on the blower, and the fume
gently spread through the green-house, or
among the plants. By putting a little of the
moxa or Spanish tinder among the tobacco,
or using it alone, caterpillars, butterflies,
snails, &amp;c., may be stupified, when they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
fall from the branches, and may be gathered
up and destroyed. An excellent preventive
remedy is to wash the stems and branches of
deciduous rose-trees, in winter, with water
heated to 200°, or with a mixture of strong
tobacco-water and soft-soap; cleaning the
branches well at the same time with a soft
brush. The American blight which infests
apple-trees is another species of aphis, and
may be destroyed in the same manner.</p>

<p>Besides the insects already enumerated,
there are several kinds of beetles, which
devour plants both in the larva and perfect
state. Of these, the cockchafer remains in
the larva state four years, and is one of the
most destructive insects known; the rose
beetle, or rose chaffer (Cetonia aurata) is
extremely beautiful, from its splendid wing
cases of burnished green and gold. These
beetles, notwithstanding their shape, which
looks too heavy and clumsy for flying, may
frequently, in hot summer weather, be seen
upon the wing, making a loud buzzing noise.
When taken up in the hand, they draw up
their feet, and appear to be dead; but, after
having been handled, and even tossed about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
for some time, they will, if a favourable
opportunity appears to offer, suddenly spread
out their wings and buzz away, leaving their
captor too much astonished to be able to
make any effort to retain them. Several
of these insects may often be found in one
rose; but they are supposed to be only
engaged in sucking the honey from the
flower, and not injuring it. They undergo
their transformations under ground, and the
grubs are supposed to live entirely on little
bits of rotten wood. Besides the insects
already mentioned, the various kinds of
weevils, the wire-worm, the thrips, the red
spider, or rather mite (Acarus telarius),
various kinds of tipula, or Gaffer long-legs,
wood lice, and earth-worms, are all found on
plants, and are all more or less injurious to
them. In the general destruction of insects,
the Lady-bird should always be spared, as,
both in its larva and its perfect state, it lives
on the larvæ of the green fly, or aphis.</p>

<p><i>Snails and Slugs</i> are more destructive to
vegetation than any kind of insect; and
they are still more difficult to get rid of.
There is a very small gray slug, that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
peculiarly injurious to plants in pots; the
large grey is also very destructive, and the
common garden snail. The beautifully
banded snail (Helix nemoralis) is, however,
supposed to live partly on earth-worms, and
the shell slug (Testacella scutella) lives entirely
on them. The usual modes of entrapping
snails, slugs, and wood-lice, are laying
down slices of raw potatoes or cabbage-leaves
at night, and examining them before
the dew is off the plants in the morning.
As, however, this requires very early rising,
a more convenient method is to lay a few
flower pots upon their sides, where the snails
have committed their ravages; and the snails,
which can neither move nor feed unless the
ground be wet with dew or rain, will generally
be found to take refuge in the
flower pots from the heat of the sun. They
are likewise often found in the middle of
the day, sticking against walls, under ivy, or
box edgings. In gardens very much infested
with snails, search should be made in winter
among all the ivy and box in the garden;
and all the snails found in a torpid state
should be destroyed. This, though some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
may escape, will effectually prevent them
from becoming numerous; and, as the eggs
are not laid till April or May, care should
be taken, before that season, to destroy all
the snails that can be found. The eggs
are round, almost transparent, and of a
bluish white; and they are always found in
small clusters, buried in the ground.</p>

</div>

<p class="c less sp">THE KITCHEN-GARDEN—THE MANAGEMENT<br>
OF CULINARY VEGETABLES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> almost all gardens, it is customary to set
apart a portion of the ground for the culture
of culinary vegetables; and, in villas and
country seats, this portion is quite detached
from the pleasure-ground, and is called the
kitchen-garden. When this is the case, it
usually consists of a square or oblong piece
of ground, varying from one to five acres
in extent, according to the size of the establishment,
and enclosed by a wall ten or
twelve feet high. If a greater extent of
ground than two or three acres be required,
it is generally laid out in two or more
gardens, communicating with each other, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
as to afford an extent of wall proportionate
to that of the ground. In front of the wall
is a border for the roots of the fruit trees,
ten or twelve feet wide, and beyond that
a walk usually four feet wide, leaving a plot
of ground in the centre for the culture of
culinary vegetables and espalier fruit-trees.
The central plat is usually divided by a main
walk up the centre, five or six feet wide,
and two or four side-walks, three or four feet
wide; the smaller plots enclosed between
these walks being again divided into oblong
compartments, or beds.</p>

<p><i>The general form and arrangement of all
large kitchen-gardens</i> being alike, it is obvious
that they must have been determined by
some general principle; and this principle
appears to be utility. The walks are made
straight, that the heavy loads wheeled along
them may not be in danger of overturning,
which they would if the walks took a serpentine
direction; while the compartments are
divided into oblong beds, for the convenience
of digging and cropping; it being found
most convenient to sow vegetables in straight
lines, to allow of weeding and hoeing between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
them, earthing up, &amp;c. For these
reasons, all pieces of ground in small gardens
appropriated to the culture of kitchen vegetables
should be made to approximate, as
closely as possible, in form and general
arrangement, to regular kitchen gardens;
and, where there is any portion of the
ground that cannot be brought into a rectangular
shape, it should be set aside for
tart-rhubarb, artichokes, or some other permanent
crop; and a square or oblong plot
in the centre be reserved for peas and beans,
and other annual vegetables.</p>

<p><i>The best soil for a kitchen garden</i> is a sandy
loam, and the surface soil should be from two
feet to three feet deep. If it is on a clayey
sub-soil, every part of the garden should be
well drained; as from the quantity of manure
required for cultivating culinary vegetables,
if any water should be suffered to remain in
a stagnant state in the soil, it would be particularly
injurious. The ground, if possible,
should slope to the south or south-east; and
it should, at any rate, be sheltered from the
prevailing winds of the locality.</p>

<p>When there is only one detached kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
garden, it is usual to surround it entirely, or
on three sides, with a piece of ground called
a slip, consisting of a fruit-tree border, and a
walk with perhaps a narrow bed beyond it,
bounded by a low hedge. This is done in
order that fruit-trees may be grown on both
sides of the wall. The vinery and forcing
houses are generally placed facing the main
walk of the garden; and what is called the
melon-ground, which forms a small walled
garden, is often placed behind them. This,
however, is not essential; but the melon-ground
should always be as near as possible
to the stable-offices, for the convenience of
carting manure; and both it and the kitchen
garden should be near the house, and have a
convenient road to it concealed from the
pleasure-ground. In small suburban gardens
there should always be a convenient, and, if
possible, partially concealed, road for servants
to bring in vegetables; and there should be
a little plot of ground for thyme, mint, sage,
parsley, &amp;c., very near the kitchen door.</p>

<p><i>Walks.</i>—The obvious use of walks in a
garden constructed on a general principle of
utility, is to enable the gardener and others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
to reach every part of the garden as speedily
as possible, without treading on the beds;
and for this reason, though the walks are
made to intersect each other at right angles,
it is customary in many gardens to round
the central beds adjoining them at the
corners. Paths two feet wide are also made
between the beds into which the compartments
are divided; and the beds themselves
are never wider than a man can conveniently
reach across to the middle to rake or hoe.
These paths, however, as they vary according
to the nature of the crop, are never made of
any permanent materials; and the whole
compartment is generally dug over when
necessary, without paying any regard to
them, and re-divided into fresh beds every
season.</p>

<p>The walks, on the contrary, being intended
to be permanent, are of a very different nature;
and, in addition to their obvious uses,
it is essentially requisite that they should be
hard and firm. This is necessary, as the
manure, &amp;c. wanted in a kitchen garden, is
generally distributed through the garden in
a wheelbarrow; and the weight in the act of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
wheeling is principally thrown upon a very
narrow wheel, which, on soft walks, literally
ploughs its way through the gravel, leaving
an uneven furrow, extremely offensive to the
eye. To avoid this inconvenience, the walks
in kitchen gardens, where expense is not an
object, are frequently made of cement or
asphalt, or laid with bricks or flag-stones;
but as all these materials give the idea of a
court-yard, rather than a garden, most persons
prefer gravel walks. Where gravel is
to be employed, the intended walks are
marked out with two garden lines; the space
between is then dug out, generally in the
form of an inverted arch, from one foot to
two feet deep in the centre, according to the
nature of the soil, and the expense it may be
thought advisable to incur; and the excavation
is filled to within six inches of the top
with brick-bats, stones, or any other hard rubbish
that can be procured. If the excavation
be made in the shape of an inverted arch, in
filling it up the extreme point of the arch
should be left hollow to serve as a drain; and
if it be made rectangular, a drain is generally
left on each side. In filling in the rubbish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the largest pieces are thrown in first, then
smaller ones, and lastly pieces broken very
small, which are rammed down, or rolled, so
as to form a smooth surface immediately
under the gravel. This is done both to give
solidity to the walk, and to prevent the
gravel from being wasted by trickling down
between the interstices of the stones. As
walks can never be firm unless they are kept
quite dry, in all cases there should be at
least one drain to each walk. The gravel
before laying down should be sifted, and all
stones, larger than a moderate-sized gooseberry,
should be thrown out or broken; and
as soon as it is laid down and evenly spread, it
should be well rolled, previously to which, if
it should be very dry, it ought to be sprinkled
with water. If the gravel be at all loose, it
should be mixed with equal parts of brick-dust
and Roman cement before laying it
down; or the gravel should be mixed with
burnt clay powdered, in the proportion of one
wheelbarrow full of clay, to a two-horse cartload
of gravel; or if the gravel be already
laid, and it is wished to render the walk
more firm, powdered burnt clay may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
strewn over it, and raked in. In all these
cases, the walks must be immediately well
watered, and afterwards heavily rolled.
Sometimes the clay is mixed with water
before applying it to the gravel. Tolerably
firm walks may be made of sea gravel, or
powdered sandstone, where good gravel cannot
be procured, or even of sand by this
treatment. The clay may be burnt by
making it into a heap, intermixed and surrounded
with faggot wood; or, as a substitute
for burning, it may be dried by spreading it
on the top of the furnace or boiler employed
to heat the hothouses. Gravel walks are
generally slightly raised in the middle, to
throw off the water to the sides; and they
are very frequently supplied with gratings, to
prevent large stones, or any kind of rubbish,
from being washed down by the rain into the
drains so as to choke them up. When the
walks in a kitchen garden are formed of flag
stones, artificial stone, or brick, the material
used is laid on brick arches or piers; and
when grass walks are employed, they require
no other preparation than marking them out
on the ground, consolidating it by pressure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and then laying them with turf. Grass
walks were formerly common in kitchen-gardens,
but they are manifestly unsuitable,
being more injured than any others by the
wheelbarrow, and unfit to walk on in wet
weather.</p>

<p><i>When gravel walks want renovating</i>, the
gravel should be loosened with a pick,
turned over, raked, and firmly rolled, adding
a coating of fresh gravel wherever it may
be found necessary. Weeds may be prevented
from growing on gravel walks by
watering the walks with salt and water.
The salt will also kill the weeds already
there, and, if these are large, they should,
of course, be hoed up and raked off.</p>

<p><i>Box edgings</i> are better than any others for
gravel walks. They are generally planted
in March or April. A garden line being
first drawn tightly along the earth bordering
the walk; a shallow trench is then opened
close to the gravel, and the earth from it
thrown on the bed. The box is pulled into
separate plants, and the branches and roots
of each trimmed till all the plants are very
nearly of the same size. The plants are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
then put into the trench, with no earth between
them and the gravel; and the trench
is filled up by drawing the earth into it, and
pressing it close to the roots, so as to make
the plants quite firm. Nothing else is requisite
but a few waterings, till the box
begins to grow; and the only difficulty is to
keep the plants in a straight line, with the
points of their shoots at an equal distance
above the soil. When box edgings are
pruned, they should always be cut in with a
knife, and never clipped with shears. They
should also never be suffered to grow too
high without pruning; and they should be
occasionally taken up and replanted wider
apart, when their stems appear to be becoming
naked below.</p>

<p><i>Cropping.</i>—The crops grown in the open
air in a kitchen-garden are of two kinds,—those
produced by the fruit trees, and those
of the herbaceous vegetables; and the latter
are again divided into the permanent crops,
and the temporary ones. The permanent
crops are those which remain for a number
of years in one place, producing a crop, year
after year, from the same roots; such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
asparagus, artichokes, rhubarb, &amp;c.: while
the temporary crops are those that require
sowing or fresh planting every year, and
these should never be sown for two years in
succession on the same ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Permanent Crops.</span>—In regular kitchen
gardens, it is of very little consequence
where the permanent crops are placed, as
every part of the ground is generally alike
accessible from the walks, and alike suitable
for cultivation. But in small gardens the
case is different; and there are generally
some awkward corners, which are best set
apart for the lasting crops. The part to be
sown annually should be always divided into
compartments, in order to manage properly
the rotation of crops.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus Beds.</i>—Of all the permanent
crops grown in a garden, the one which
requires most preparation is asparagus. It
is not perhaps generally known that this
plant is a native of Britain; but the fact
is, that it grows wild in several places both
in England and Scotland. The cultivated
plant is, however, of course, very different
from the wild one; for, while the latter is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
meagre, insipid, and very tough, the former
is not only succulent and finely flavoured,
but grows to an enormous size. There are
three sorts of asparagus grown for the London
market: the Battersea, which has a thick
whitish stalk, only just tipped with a pinkish
head; the Gravesend, which is much more
slender, and has both the stalk and head
green; and the Giant, which is an enormous
variety of the first. Asparagus is always
raised from seed; but, as the stalks are not
fit to cut till the roots are two or three years
old, persons wishing to plant an asparagus
bed generally purchase one-year or two-years’
old plants from a nurseryman.</p>

<p>Asparagus plants require a light, rich,
sandy loam, and the ground in which they
are to be planted is always first trenched
from three to four feet deep, or even more,
and plenty of stable dung is buried at the
bottom of the trench; the beds are then
marked out four feet wide, with paths two
feet wide left between, and the plants are
planted in rows about six inches deep (the
crown of the root being left about two inches
below the surface), and nine inches apart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
The beds are generally covered during winter
with rotten manure, which is forked in,
and the beds raked in spring; and this
treatment should be repeated every year, or
every two or three years at farthest, the
beds being slightly covered, in the intermediate
years, with litter, leaves, &amp;c., which
may be raked off in spring. The stalks
should not be cut till the third year after
planting; but, after that, the roots will continue
to produce freely for twelve or fourteen
years. Asparagus is cut generally a little
below the surface, with a sharp knife, slanting
upwards; and the market-gardeners cut
all the shoots produced for two months,—say
from April till Midsummer,—but suffer all
the shoots that push up after that period to
expand their leaves, in order that they may
elaborate their sap, and thus strengthen the
roots. Whole fields of this plant are cultivated
by the market-gardeners near London,
to the extent, as it is said, of from eighty to
a hundred acres, chiefly near Mortlake, Battersea,
and Deptford. During the last four
or five years, these fields, and many private
gardens near London, have been infested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
with a most beautiful little beetle, striped
with red, black, and blue, which eats through
the shoots close to the ground almost as soon
as they appear. Asparagus is generally
forced by covering the beds with manure,
and by deepening the alleys between the
beds, and filling them with manure also.</p>

<p><i>Sea-Kale.</i>—About seventy years ago, Dr.
Lettsom, a celebrated physician and botanist
of that day, happened to be travelling near
Southampton, when he observed some plants
pushing their way up through the sea-sand.
Finding the shoots of these plants quite succulent,
he enquired of some person in the
neighbourhood if they were ever eaten, and
was answered, that the country people had
been in the habit of boiling these shoots and
eating them as a vegetable from time immemorial.
The doctor tasted them, and found
them so good, that he took some seed to his
friend Mr. Curtis, the originator of the
“Botanical Magazine,” who had then a nursery
in Lambeth Marsh. Mr. Curtis wrote
a book about the plant which brought it
into notice, and he sold the seed in small
packets at a high price: and thus, this long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
neglected British plant, which for so many
years was only eaten by the poorest fishermen,
became our highly prized and much
esteemed sea-kale, which is now so great a
favourite at the tables of the rich.</p>

<p>Sea-kale is raised either from seeds or cuttings
of the roots. In either case, when the
plants are a year old, they are put into a
bed thoroughly prepared as if for asparagus,
and planted in the same manner. The first
year the plants will require little care, except
cutting down the flower-stems wherever they
appear; but the second year they will be
ready for forcing. This is performed by
covering the plants first with river-sand;
then turning what are called sea-kale pots
over them, and lastly, covering the pots to
the depth of fifteen or twenty inches with
fresh stable dung, the heat from which will
draw the shoots up, and make them succulent
and fit to eat.</p>

<p><i>Artichokes</i> are another kind of permanent
crop, but they are not suitable for growing
in a small garden. The artichoke is a native
of Italy, said to have been introduced
in the reign of Henry VIII. It is propagated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
by division, and requires a light, rich,
and rather moist soil. Manure should be
laid between the rows every autumn, and
the plants covered with straw in severe weather
in winter. Artichoke-plants do not
continue to produce good heads longer than
six or seven years; but young plants come
into bearing the second year after transplanting.</p>

<p><i>Strawberries.</i>—Though strawberries should
be properly included in the list of fruits,
they are generally classed by gardeners
among the permanent herbaceous crops in a
kitchen-garden. There are a great variety
of named sorts grown in gardens; but they
are mostly varieties or sub-varieties of three
species, viz.: the Pine (Fragaria grandiflora),
which is supposed to be originally
from Surinam; the Chili (F. Chilensis), and
the Scarlet (F. Virginiana). Of these the
pine-strawberries are large, pale in colour,
but with scarlet flesh, and of a very fine and
delicate flavour. The best strawberries are
Keen’s seedling, and the old pine; the Chili
strawberries (one of which is Wilmot’s Superb)
have very large fruit, with white flesh, but possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
very little flavour; and the scarlet-strawberries
have small, bright-red, slightly acid
fruit, which is principally used for ice-creams
and preserving. To these may be added the
Hautbois (F. elatior), which, though so often
mentioned by the street vendors, is in reality
very seldom grown, from the fruit, which is
small and blackish, being rarely produced
in any quantity; the Green strawberries (F.
collina and F. virides); the Alpine strawberries
(F. semperflorens); and the common
wild Wood strawberry (F. vesca).</p>

<p>Strawberries should be grown on rich
loamy soil, and they are generally planted in
beds three feet wide, three rows in a bed.
Every year, the strongest of the runners
should be taken off, and planted to form a
succession crop, as the beds seldom remain
good more than three or four years. When
the old beds are suffered to remain, they
should be covered with manure in winter
to be forked in in spring. When strawberries
are wanted for forcing, pots are
placed near the beds, and the runners are
placed over them, and kept down with a
stone, or hooked down with pegs to root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p><i>Tart Rhubarb.</i>—The part of the rhubarb
used for making pies and puddings is the
footstalk of the leaf; and the kinds usually
grown in gardens for this purpose are Rheum
Rhaponticum, a native of Asia introduced in
1573, and Rheum Undulatum, a native of
China introduced in 1734. Rheum Palmatum,
the leaves of which are very deeply cut
with pointed segments, is generally supposed
to be the kind, the root of which is used in
medicine, under the name of Turkey Rhubarb.
Buck’s Elford, or Scarlet Rhubarb,
has slender stalks, but is valuable for its
beautiful colour; and the Tobolsk, the Giant,
and the Victoria Rhubarb, are remarkable
for the enormous size of their stalks. Rheum
Australe, which is by some said to be the
medicinal kind, and which is only lately introduced,
has also enormous leaves, and very
long thick stalks, the skin of which is rough,
while the pulp tastes like that of apples.</p>

<p>Rhubarb is either raised from seed, or propagated
by offsets, or dividing the crown of
the root. The seed is sown in April, in
light rich soil, and the plants are pricked out
in autumn into a bed of rich sandy loam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
which has been dug over, or trenched to the
depth of eighteen inches or two feet. The
plants require no other care than an occasional
autumn or spring coating of manure
to be slightly forked in, this dressing to be
only applied, when, from the leaves and stalks
produced being smaller than usual, the roots
appear to want nourishment; and if they
seem crowded, they may be occasionally
taken up and replanted further apart. Rhubarb
may be forced by covering it with pots
and manure, like sea-kale; or the roots may
be planted in a box, and kept in the house
on a stove, or near the fire in the kitchen,
covering the box with a bast mat to keep the
plant in darkness and free from the dust, and
watering it frequently.</p>

<p><i>Horse radish</i> grows best in rich alluvial
soil; and it is propagated by cuttings of the
crowns of the roots, each about two inches
long. The ground is then prepared by
trenching at least two feet deep, and the
cuttings or sets are planted in a kind of
furrow about fifteen inches deep, with their
crowns upwards. The second year the roots
may be taken up, and the crowns cut off and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
replanted. As the sets are planted in March,
and the leaves seldom begin to appear till
the following June or July, it is customary
to sow a light crop, of lettuce for example,
or spinage, on the surface of the ground over
the horse radish sets; which crop is cleared
off in time to make way for the leaves of the
true crop. When the sticks of horse-radish
are taken up, they may be kept in sand in a
cellar or out-house till wanted for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Temporary Crops, and their Rotation.</span>—It
has been already observed, that temporary
crops should never be grown two years
in succession on the same ground; and the
reason for this has been already alluded to
under the head of transplanting. It is, that
the roots of plants every year throw out a
quantity of excrementitious matter that they
either will not reimbibe, or that is injurious
to them; and that thus, the ground in which
they have been grown one year, becomes
unfit for them to grow in the next. This
danger is obviated in the case of perennial
plants, and trees and shrubs, by the constant
elongation of the roots, which spread farther
and farther every year, beyond the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of the unwholesome soil. This, however, is
not the case with annuals, as the roots of the
plants of one year are no longer than those
were of the plants of the preceding year; and
consequently as every year’s plants occupy
exactly the same ground, when annuals are
sown for several years in the same soil they
must degenerate; or, in other words, become
weak and small, from not having enough of
wholesome food, or from being forced to
take food unwholesome for them. Now it
has been found, that excrementitious matter,
though poisonous to the plant that exudes it,
is extremely nourishing to other plants, completely
differing from the first in nature; and
what is meant by the rotation of crops, is the
art of making plants of opposite natures
succeed each other, till the ground shall be
so completely cleared of the excrementitious
matter exuded by the first crop, as to be
ready to receive it again. It is true that the
same ground may occasionally be made to
bear the same crops for several successive
years, by copious manuring, or by trenching;
but in both cases the evil is overcome by
supplying the plant with abundance of nourishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and thus preventing it from being
driven to the necessity of taking unwholesome
food. In fixing the rotation of crops,
plants differing as much as possible in their
habits should be chosen to succeed each
other; as, for example, onions may be succeeded
by lettuces; carrots by peas; potatoes
by cabbage; turnips by spinach, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>The Cabbage Tribe.</i>—Few persons unacquainted
with botany will be able to believe
that brocoli, cauliflowers, cabbages, Scotch
or German Greens, Brussels sprouts and
savoys, not only all belong to one genus, but
are actually varieties of one species of a
genus, viz. Brassica oleracea; and that the
turnip, the Swedish turnip, and the rape (the
seed of which is used for oil), belong to other
species of the same genus. The cabbage, in
its wild state, is a biennial which grows
naturally on the sea-coast in different parts
of England, and is a tall straggling plant
with loose leaves, and a rather pretty yellow
cruciferous flower. The borecole or kale is
the first improvement effected by cultivation;
and the cauliflower the last. Indeed it is
impossible to imagine a greater difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
between any species and variety, than exists
between the cauliflower and the original wild
cabbage plant. All the varieties of the cabbage
tribe require a soil which has been
enriched with abundance of animal manure;
and when decaying, they have all a peculiarly
offensive smell like that of putrid meat, from
the large quantity of azote that they contain.</p>

<p><i>The Cabbage.</i>—The word “cabbage,” in its
original signification, means a firm head or
ball of leaves folded closely over each other;
and thus, there is a cabbage lettuce, and a
cabbage rose. The cabbages grown in gardens
are usually sown at three different
times; for the spring, summer, and autumn
crop. The spring cabbages are sown in
summer generally about the first week in
August, in an open airy situation, and in
light soil. When they come up, they are
thinned; and in October or November they
are ready for planting out in rows, twelve or
eighteen inches apart, into the beds where
they are to cabbage. In small gardens, cabbages
are seldom raised from seed; but the
plants are purchased when ready for planting
out. The summer crop is sown in February,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
and planted out in rows eighteen inches or
two feet apart; and the autumn crop is sown
in May, and planted out in July, generally
eighteen inches apart every way. All cabbages
require a rich soil, and frequent hoeing
up; and in dry weather they should be
watered to make them succulent. The stalks
of the spring cabbages are generally pulled
up and carried to the refuse heap as soon as
the cabbages are cut; but the stalks of the
summer and autumn kinds are left standing,
that they may throw out what are called
sprouts. The culture of the red cabbage is
exactly the same; except that there is no
spring crop, and the stalks are never left
standing for sprouts. Some gardeners sow
only one crop of green cabbages, and leave
the stalks standing to produce sprouts all the
rest of the year. When the cabbage stalk
is left for sprouts, it is customary, after cutting
the cabbage, to give the stalk two cuts across,
so as to divide the top into four; as when
this is done, it is thought to produce sprouts
with more certainty.</p>

<p><i>Coleworts</i> are young cabbages gathered
before they form a head; and they are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
sown in June or July for an autumn,
winter, or early spring crop. As they are
always eaten young, they need not be planted
more than ten or twelve inches apart every
way; and when they are gathered the stalks
are always pulled up and thrown away.</p>

<p><i>Savoys and Brussels sprouts.</i>—Savoys are
large cabbages with wrinkled leaves, the
seed of which is sown about the end of
March, in order that the crop may be ready
for the table in November. The culture is
the same as that of cabbages, except that as
the savoys are large, they should be planted
out in the bed where they are to cabbage,
two feet apart every way. Brussels sprouts
are a variety of the savoy cabbage; the
plants first produce a small savoy on an
elongated stalk, and when this is cut off, the
long stalk throws out a number of little cabbages
from its sides, which are the Brussels
sprouts. The culture is the same as for the
Savoys, except that the plants, as they do
not spread, need not be more than a foot or
eighteen inches apart every way; and that
the seed is generally procured from Brussels,
as that ripened in England is said to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
inferior plants. Both savoys and Brussels
sprouts are much better if not cut till there
has been some frost upon them; and they are
consequently of great value as winter vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Brocoli and Cauliflower.</i>—The cauliflower
(the name of which is supposed to be derived
from <i>caulis</i>, a stalk, and <i>florens</i>, flowering,) is
a native of Cyprus, introduced in 1694;
and no one unacquainted with the details of
its culture, and who has seen the immense
quantities brought to the London market,
could credit the extraordinary care bestowed
on each plant to bring it to perfection.
Cauliflowers take nearly a year from their
first sowing to bring them into a state fit for
the table; and as the plants are too tender
to bear an English winter without protection,
they require to be grown in frames, or sheltered
by hand glasses during frosty weather.
The seed is sown in August, in a bed of rich
light earth, and the ground is occasionally
watered till the plants appear. They are
then shaded with mats during the heat of the
day, and thinned out, so as to leave the plants
a little distance apart. In September they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
are pricked out into beds of rich earth, and
watered and shaded; and about the end of
October, or beginning of November, they are
transplanted into frames, or into beds, richly
manured with rotten dung, spread over the
ground three or four inches thick, and
trenched in, a spade deep; after which, they
are watered and covered with hand-glasses.
During the whole winter they require constant
attention, slightly watering them, and
raising the glasses to give them air in fine
weather; and covering up the glasses closely
with mats or straw in severe frosts, and
during the continuance of sharp winds.
They must also be frequently looked at, to
pick off decayed leaves, &amp;c., which might
rot the stem; and the ground in which they
grow must be strewed with a mixture of
lime and soot, to protect them from the attacks
of caterpillars and slugs. Care must
also be taken by giving air, &amp;c., to prevent
them from being drawn up, or running to
flower too soon. At length spring arrives,
and the plants which have safely survived
the winter must be looked over, and thinned
out so that only one or two may be left to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
each glass; the earth is then loosened, the
plants regularly watered, and the glasses
taken off in the middle of the day, but carefully
replaced at night. At last, towards the
end of April, the glasses are removed altogether,
and in May some of the plants will
begin to make heads; but even then the care
bestowed on them must not cease. The
plants must be examined daily, and some of
the leaves turned down over the flowers, to
preserve them from the rays of the sun, which
would turn them brown, and from the rain
which would rot them. At length, about the
end of May, or in June and July, the cauliflowers
are ready for the market; and little do
the purchasers of them think of the labour and
unremitting attention which, for so many
months, have been required to rear them.
A second crop, sown in February and planted
out in April, will be ready in August; and a
third crop, sown in May and planted out in
July, will be in perfection about Michaelmas
or October, and may be preserved in mild
weather till near Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Brocoli</i> is generally supposed to be a
variety of the cauliflower; but it differs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
essentially, both in being much hardier, and
in being very apt to vary. Thus, while
only two kinds of cauliflower are known, the
early and the late, and even these can hardly
be distinguished from each other,—there
are ten or twelve distinct sorts of brocoli,
and more are being raised every day. All
these kinds, however, appear to have sprung
from two, the purple and the green, which
are said to have been brought from Italy.
Brocoli is grown for the table in autumn,
winter, and early spring; but there is no
summer crop. The principal seasons for
sowing are February and April for the autumn
and winter crops, and June for the
spring crop; and the plants succeed best in
fresh loamy soil, or, if this cannot be procured,
in ground that has been deeply
trenched and well manured. The culture
is like that of cabbages, except that, in very
severe winters, the plants require a little
protection.</p>

<p><i>The Borecole</i> is generally known in England
by the name of Scotch kale, and in
Scotland by that of German greens. There
are many different sub-varieties, fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of which are enumerated in the <i>Ency. of
Gard.</i>; but all the kinds agree in being
generally sown in April, and transplanted in
June. They require no other culture, except
hoeing and earthing up; and, as they
are exceedingly hardy, they are very valuable
vegetables for winter use.</p>

<p><i>The Leguminous tribe.</i>—Vegetables belonging
to this tribe generally occupy the
ground but a few months in the summer,
and are thus very suitable, in the rotation of
crops, to precede or follow those of the
cabbage tribe, which occupy the ground the
greater part of a year.</p>

<p><i>Peas.</i>—The list of peas is almost interminable,
and it is continually changing; so
that what may be considered the fashionable
peas of one season are generally superseded
the next by some others, to which every
possible merit is attributed. There are,
however, some very distinct kinds, the principal
of which are—the dwarf early kinds,
which are dry and mealy when full-grown,
and become whitish when they are old; the
Prussian and marrow-fat peas, which are
soft and juicy, with a rich marrowy flavour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
and which remain green even when quite
ripe; and the sugar peas, which are boiled,
like kidney beans, in their pods. The soil
for peas should be a light, dry, sandy loam,
tolerably rich, but not freshly-manured;
and, for this reason, they are particularly
well adapted to succeed any of the cabbage-tribe,
for which a great deal of manure is
required. They should generally have an
open sunny situation; and the early crops
should be sheltered from the prevailing winds
of the district. If peas are sown in freshly-manured,
very moist, or clayey soil, they
will run to haulm, that is, they will produce
more leaves and stalks than peas: and, if
grown in calcareous soil, they will boil hard
and tough, even when young, and when old
will never become floury.</p>

<p>The early peas are small, and few in each
pod, and with so little flavour, that we never
have them sown in our little garden, but
have the green Prussians sown early for a
first crop, and again, a little later, for a
second. The early dwarf peas are, indeed,
of little use, except for forcing. They are,
however, frequently sown in November and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
December, to stand the winter in the open
border, in order that they may produce a
crop the following May or June. When
forced, they are sown in pots plunged in a
hotbed, and transplanted into the open border
in March; turning them out of the pots
into holes made to receive them, without
breaking the balls of earth round the roots.
In some cases, they are fruited in pots
placed in a greenhouse, or even stove; by
which means, when it is thought worth
while to incur the expense, fresh green peas
may be had at Christmas. The main crop
of early peas is, however, sown in February.
A pint of small early peas will sow twenty
yards of drills; each drill being one inch
and a half deep, and the drills two or three
feet asunder. The drills are marked out
by stretching a garden-line lengthways along
the bed, and then making a drill or furrow
along it with a dibber; the earth is pressed
firm at the bottom of the drill by the very
act of making it, and the peas are then
distributed along it, two or three to every
inch, or wider apart, according to their size,
and covered with soil, which is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
trodden down or rolled. When attacks are
apprehended from mice, dried furze is generally
strewed over the peas as soon as they
are put into the ground, and before they are
covered with earth; and this is efficacious,
not only in protecting the peas from their
enemies, but in keeping enough air about
them to allow them to vegetate. They
should then be well watered, and will require
no further care till they come up.
When they are two or three inches high,
they should be hoed; that is, the weeds
which may have sprung up between the
rows should be hoed up, and the earth drawn
up to the roots of the peas. When about
six inches high, they should be staked, with
two rows of sticks to each row of peas; the
sticks being about a foot higher than the
average height of the peas, and care being
taken never to let them cross at top.</p>

<p>Late peas only differ in their culture from
the early crops in having their drills farther
apart, and in being placed farther apart in
the drills. A pint of these peas is calculated
to sow thirty-three yards of rows, and the
peas of the larger kinds should be from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
inch to two inches, or even more apart in
the drills. Dwarf Marrowfats and Blue
Prussians are, however, frequently sown about
three in two inches. The time of sowing
usually varies from April to July; but
where no early peas are grown, even the late
kinds may be sown as early as February or
March. The tall-growing kinds should,
however, never be suffered to stand the winter;
and they should not be sown before
March, unless the weather appear likely to
be open, on account of the greater difficulties
attending tall-growing plants. It may indeed
be here observed, though the fact is
obvious, that all dwarf-growing plants are
much better adapted for forcing, than the
tall-growing kinds; from their being much
more easily sheltered and protected. Peas
should always be eaten when freshly gathered,
as they are perhaps more injured by
keeping than any other vegetable. The pea
is a native of the south of Europe, and it
is supposed to have been introduced in the
reign of Henry VIII.</p>

<p><i>Beans</i>, though belonging to the same natural
order as peas, and generally classed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with them by persons speaking of garden
products, yet differ in several very important
particulars: for instance, they will grow in
much stronger soil; they do not require
sticks; and they are generally topped, that
is, the leading shoot of each plant is cut off,
an operation that would be fatal to peas.
There are many different kinds of beans,
though not so many as of peas; and the
different varieties may be divided into the
early and the late. The early beans may be
sown in drills in November or December,
to stand the winter; but the main crop is
generally sown in January or February.
The late beans are sown in March and April,
and some even so late as June; and instead
of drills, a hole is made for each bean separately
with a dibber. Both sorts are covered
with earth, which is pressed down and then
watered; and they require no further care
till the beans are three or four inches high,
when they should be hoed and earthed up.
As soon as the plants come into blossom,
the tops are cut off; and this is said not
only to increase the crop, but to prevent the
plants from being attacked with the insect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
called the black blight. The crop should be
gathered when the beans are about half ripe.
The bean is said to be a native of Egypt;
and it is supposed to have been brought to
England by the Romans.</p>

<p><i>Kidney-Beans</i> differ from the other leguminous
vegetables, in their pods being eaten.
There are two distinct kinds, the Dwarf
Kidney-Beans, and the Scarlet-Runners;
and these are again divided into numerous
subdivisions. The soil for the dwarf kinds
should be similar to that for peas: viz., rich,
light, and dry, but not newly manured; and
it should have been well pulverized to the
depth of a foot or eighteen inches. The
drills are generally made about two inches
deep; and two feet or two feet and a half
apart. The seeds are sown the first or second
week in May. As the plants grow,
they may be earthed up; and if the plants
are very vigorous, and appear disposed to
run to haulm, a few of the leading shoots may
have their tops pinched off; but this should
be done carefully, and the operation confined
to a few of the strongest growing plants.
The scarlet-runners require nearly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
culture, except that the seeds should be
sown two or three inches asunder, and only
lightly covered; and that the rows should be
at least three feet apart. The seeds are
covered lightly, as abundance of both air and
moisture are required to make seeds enveloped
in so thick a skin germinate; and
the rows must be wide apart on account of
their height, as otherwise the crop would
not get enough sun and air. The scarlet-runner
is properly a perennial, and if the
plants are cut down to the ground after producing
their crop, and their roots are covered
with dry litter, they will produce an early
and abundant crop the following summer.
Kidney-beans are very frequently forced
nearly in the same manner as peas; viz., by
sowing them in pots plunged in a hot-bed,
and then removing them to a hot-house or
green-house (according to the season) to
fruit. Sometimes they are sown in the earth
of the hot-bed, and fruited there like cucumbers.
The dwarf kidney-bean is a native of
India, and was introduced before the time of
Gerard; but the scarlet-runner is a native
of South America, and was not introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
till 1633, when it was at first only cultivated
in the flower-garden as an ornamental plant,
and it is treated as such by all the early
writers on flowers.</p>

<p><i>The Potatoe</i> is a native of South America,
but it was first brought to England by Sir
Walter Raleigh, from Virginia. It was
hence called the Potatoe of Virginia; and it
was at its first introduction thought very
inferior to the Convolvulus Batatus, which
was called the Spanish Potatoe, and to the
Jerusalem Artichoke, which was called the
Potatoe of Canada, from its having been first
taken from South America to Canada, before
it was brought to England. About twenty
or thirty sorts of the common potatoe are
now cultivated for the table; but so large a
quantity is wanted in almost every family,
that few persons attempt to grow their main
crop in a garden. A few early potatoes are,
however, grown frequently; and the best of
these is decidedly the ash-leaved kidney.
The soil for potatoes should be a light, fresh,
unmanured loam, and when manure is applied,
it should be mellow dung, or well-rotted
leaves. Potatoes are generally planted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
by dividing the root into what are called
sets, with an eye in each; but sometimes
the tubers are planted whole. Seeds are
never used, except where it is wished to
raise new sorts. Potatoes are seldom good
forced; but an early crop may be raised by
planting the sets in October. The principal
early crop is, however, planted early in
March; and the principal late crop in May
or June. When the potatoes are to be
planted, the ground should be first well
pulverized, and then, the garden-line being
stretched across the beds, holes should be
made along it with the dibber from two to
four or five inches deep, and about a foot
apart. The sets should then be put one in
each hole, with the eye upwards, and the
earth pressed firmly down on each. When
the potatoes come up, they should be hoed,
and again in about a fortnight or three
weeks; and when the plants are eight or ten
inches high, they should be carefully earthed
up. As soon as the plants go into blossom,
some cultivators cut off the tops, to prevent
the roots from being exhausted by the formation
of the potatoe apples, or fruit. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
tubers are ripe, the stalks begin to wither,
and may be taken up; but most persons
have not patience to wait so long, and they
begin to take up their early potatoes before
the tubers are half-grown.</p>

<p><i>The Jerusalem Artichoke</i> is a tuberous-rooted
sun-flower, a native of Brazil; the
epithet Jerusalem being a corruption of the
Italian word ‘girasole,’ signifying to turn to
the sun, from the supposed habit of the
flower. The Jerusalem artichoke is planted
in February or March, by sets, like the
potatoe; and the tubers will be ready for
use in September or October. It was introduced
in 1716.</p>

<p><i>The Turnip</i> succeeds best in a dry, sandy,
or gravelly soil, which has been well manured,
and dug to a considerable depth. The beds
should be four or five feet wide, and the
seeds having been strewed very thinly over
them, the surface should be raked smooth,
and then slightly beaten with the back of the
spade. The first sowing is generally made
in March, or the first week in April; and as
soon as the young plants shew their rough
leaves, they should be hoed up separately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
They will then seldom want any other culture
till the end of May, when, if the weather
has been favourable, they will be ready for
use. A second sowing is generally made
about the middle of May; and a third, for
the main crop, towards the end of June.
Besides the turnips usually sold in seed
shops, the Teltow, or small yellow German
turnip, the French long white, and the
Scotch yellow, are well deserving of cultivation
for their excellence. The common
turnip, the carrot, and the parsnip, are natives
of England.</p>

<p><i>Carrots</i> are of two kinds—the long carrots,
the root of which tapers gradually from the
crown to the point, and the horn carrots, the
root of which continues of nearly the same
thickness for three-fourths of its length, and
then abruptly diminishes to a very slender
tap root. There are numerous sub-varieties
of both kinds. The goodness of the carrot
depending entirely on the ease with which
the root can penetrate the soil, it is obvious
that the soil, in which these roots are grown,
must not be of a very adhesive nature; and
thus the best carrots are grown in pure sand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
or peat. When soils of this nature cannot
be procured, the ground should be trenched
two spades deep, and a very little thoroughly
rotten dung, or vegetable mould, should be
well mixed with the earth in digging the
lower spadeful. If manure, in a fresh state,
be laid on a carrot-bed, or if the soil be
not thoroughly pulverized, the roots will
become forked, fibrous, and worm-eaten.
The seeds of the carrot being each furnished
with a pappus, or feathery wing, are apt to
become entangled with each other, and can
only be separated by rubbing them between
the hands, and mixing them with sand.
They are then to be sown very thinly, the
ground slightly raked over to cover them,
and then beaten flat with the back of the
spade. When the young plants are up, the
ground should be occasionally loosened,
from time to time, with a small hoe, round
each. When the leaves begin to change
colour, the roots should be taken up, dry
weather being chosen for that purpose; and
the tops being cut off, the carrots should
be carried into a cellar, or outhouse, and
there buried in sand. Early carrots are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
generally sown in February, and the principal
crop about the middle of March.</p>

<p><i>The Parsnip</i> requires the same culture as
the carrot, except that there is no early crop.
The seed is sown in February or March, and
the roots are ready for use about the latter
end of September, or beginning of October.</p>

<p><i>The Red Beet</i> is a native of the sea-coast
on the south of Europe, and was introduced
in 1656. The seed should not be sown till
the last week in March, or the beginning of
April. The ground should previously be
dug to the depth of a foot or eighteen
inches, and mixed with a little sea or river
sand, and vegetable mould, or rotten dung.
The roots will be ready for the table in
September or October. In taking them
up, and boiling them, great care must be
taken not to wound the outer skin; as, if
they are scraped or broken, all the colouring
liquid will escape, and the root will become
of a dull, dingy, whitish pink, instead of its
usual brilliant red.</p>

<p><i>The Skirret, the Scorzonera, and the Salsify</i>,
are all tap-rooted plants, which require the
same culture as the carrot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p><i>The Radish</i> is a native of China, and was
introduced into England before 1584. There
are numerous varieties; but they may be all
divided into three or four kinds:—the spring
radishes, which are sub-divided into the
spindle-rooted, and the turnip-rooted; the
autumn kinds, which are frequently oval,
or turnip-rooted; and the winter kinds,
which are oblong and dark-coloured. The
seed may be sown at any season when the
ground is open; but the very early spring
kinds are generally sown in October or November
to stand the winter, and be ready to
draw in February and March.</p>

<p><i>Spinach.</i>—The round-leaved variety is
generally sown for a summer crop, on rich
moist soil, in January or February, if the
ground be open; and the triangular-leaved
kinds, of which the Flanders is the best, are
sown for the winter crops in August. The
summer crop, when gathered, may be pulled
up by the root; but the winter crop should
only have the outer leaves gathered, and it
will thus continue producing fresh leaves for
many months.</p>

<p><i>Sorrel</i> is generally propagated by offsets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
in spring or autumn; or, if by seed, it is
sown in March. It is, however, seldom
grown in English gardens.</p>

<p><i>The Onion tribe.</i>—Very few onions, except
for salads, are generally grown in small gardens.
Where they are grown the soil should
be a rich loam, well manured with very rotten
dung; and though the beds need not be dug
more than a spade deep, the soil to that
depth should be well pulverized. The seed
is sown broad-cast in March, on beds about
four feet wide, and after it is raked in, the
surface of the bed is rolled or beaten flat
with the spade. In about three weeks the
beds should be hoed, and thinned, as the
young onions will be then ready for salads;
and the beds should be again hoed and
thinned out, from time to time, as the onions
may be wanted. When the onions are from
three to six inches apart, they are generally
left to swell for the main crop, and they will
be ready to draw in August or September.
Many persons, about a month or six weeks
before the onions are ready to take up, bend
the stalks down flat on the bed, to throw all
the strength of the plant into the bulb, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
to prevent its thickening at the neck. Onions
for pickling are generally sown in April; and
onions for salads may be sown at intervals all
the year. When onions are wanted of a
very large size, they are sown in drills, and
regularly earthed up; and the Portugal
onions are generally transplanted. In Portugal
it is said that the alleys between the
beds are filled with manure, which is kept
constantly watered, and the water directed
over the beds. Onions of enormous size
have been grown in England by raising them
on a slight hotbed in November or December,
and transplanting them in April or May.
When they are transplanted it is into very
rich soil, three-fourths of which is rotten
manure, and only the fibrous roots are buried
in the soil, the bulb being left above ground.
The plants are placed from nine inches to a
foot apart every way, and regularly watered.
Onions thus grown are not only of enormous
size, but of very delicate flavour. Neither
the native country of the common onion, nor
the date of its introduction into England, is
known.</p>

<p><i>Leeks</i> may be treated like onions, and may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
be grown to an enormous size by transplanting
into a hole about twice their own diameter,
at the bottom of which their fibrous roots
are spread out and covered with soil, while
the bulb is left untouched by the soil, standing
in a kind of hollow cup. The plant is then
well supplied with water, and will soon swell
to fill the cavity. The leek is a native of
Switzerland, and it was introduced before
the time of Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>The Chive</i> is a perennial plant, a native of
Britain, and it is propagated by dividing the
roots in spring or autumn.</p>

<p><i>Garlic</i> is propagated by dividing the bulb
into what are called cloves, and planting them
in February or March. They are generally
planted in drills, and earthed up as they begin
to grow. When the leaves turn yellow, which
they will do about August, the bulbs should be
taken up, and what may not be wanted for
use, should be reserved for planting the following
spring. Garlic is a native of the
south of Europe, and was introduced before
the time of Henry VIII. <i>The shallot</i> is a
native of Palestine, and it has been in cultivation
in British gardens at least as long as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the garlic. It is very difficult to grow, as it
is apt to be attacked by a kind of maggot;
but it has been found to succeed planted in
cup-shaped hollows like the leek.</p>

<p>All the onion tribe require a light, rich,
well-drained soil; and they always succeed
best where there is a gravelly subsoil.</p>

<p><i>Salad plants.</i>—These are very numerous,
and include lettuces, endive, small salads,
celery, &amp;c. It is somewhat remarkable that
nearly all these were known to our ancestors,
and were in common use at British tables
dressed much as we dress them now, while
the potatoe was yet unknown, or only eaten
as a sweetmeat stewed with sack and sugar.</p>

<p><i>The lettuce</i> is said to have been introduced
in 1562, but from what country is unknown.
There are numerous varieties, but they may
be all referred to two kinds; the cabbage
lettuces which grow flat and spreading, and
the cos lettuces which grow compact and
upright. Lettuces are generally sown broad-cast,
like turnips or spinach, on beds of rich
mellow soil, at any season from January to
October; and the cabbage kinds require no
after care, but weeding and thinning out.
The cos lettuces are, however, generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
blanched by bending down the tips of the
leaves over the heart, and tying them together
with bast mat. Lettuces are also
sown by the French to cut for salads when
quite young, as we grow mustard and cress.</p>

<p><i>Endive</i> is a native of China and Japan,
introduced before 1548. It is generally
sown in large gardens at three seasons, viz.,
April, June, and August; but in small gardens
one sowing is generally thought sufficient,
and that is made in May. The seeds
are sown very thinly in beds of rich mellow
earth; and when they are from four to six
inches high, they are transplanted into beds
of rich light earth, where they are planted in
drills about a foot apart in the line; and
as they grow, are occasionally earthed up.
When the plants are about three parts grown,
the outer leaves are tied over the hearts to
blanch them, with strands of bast mat, or
osier twigs; a dry day being chosen for the
operation. Only a few plants should be tied
up at a time; and they should be seldom allowed
to stand more than a fortnight or three
weeks after the operation; as, if they remain
longer, particularly if the weather be wet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
they begin to rot. In wet or cold seasons
endive is best blanched by turning a sea-kale
pot over each root, instead of tying down the
outer leaves. There are two distinct kinds:
the broad leaved or Batavia endive, and the
curled leaved, which is the most common,
and to which the French give the name of
chicorée.</p>

<p><i>The true Chiccory or Succory</i> is sometimes
called wild endive; but the French name for
it is <i>barbe de capucin</i>. It is common in calcareous
and sandy soils in different parts of
England, where it is conspicuous from its
bright blue flowers. Its culture is the same
as that of endive; but it may also be treated
as a winter salad, by being taken up in October
or November, and stacked in cellars in
alternate layers of sand, so that the crowns of
the plants may just appear along the ridge.
Here, if the frost be excluded, the roots will
soon send out a profusion of tender succulent
leaves; which, if kept from the light, will
also be quite blanched.</p>

<p><i>Mustard and Cress.</i>—Mustard is the native
white mustard eaten in its seed leaves; and
cress is an annual cruciferous plant, introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
before 1548, but from what country is
unknown. They are both of the easiest
culture, and will not only grow in any soil or
situation, but may even be raised for the
table by spreading the seed in a saucer on
wet flannel. The flour of mustard is made
from the ground seeds of the black mustard,
which is cultivated extensively in some parts
of England for that purpose.</p>

<p><i>Corn Salad or Lamb Lettuce, Winter Cress,
Burnet, Tansey</i>, and many other plants are
occasionally used in salads, particularly on
the Continent, but they are seldom grown for
that purpose in England.</p>

<p><i>Celery</i> is frequently used in salads; and it
is interesting, as being so greatly improved by
cultivation as scarcely to be recognized; for
in its wild state it is a British plant called
smallage, which grows in ditches, and is
scarcely eatable. In gardens, celery requires
more manure than any other vegetable, except
the cabbage tribe. The seed for the principal
crop of celery is generally sown in
March or April, and the seed-bed should be
formed of equal parts of fresh dark loamy
soil, and old rotten dung. When the plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
are about two or three inches high, they are
pricked out into another bed made of very
rich soil, six or seven inches deep, on a hard
bottom; and when they are about a foot
high, they are transplanted into trenches for
blanching. The trenches are made four feet
apart, eighteen inches wide, and twelve deep;
and they are filled nine inches high with a
rich compost of strong fresh soil and rotten
dung. The plants are taken up with as
much earth as will adhere to the roots, and
the side-shoots or offsets are removed from
the central stems; they are then set by the
hand, nine or ten inches apart, in the centre
of each trench, and well watered. As the
plants in the trenches grow, the earth is
gradually drawn up to them, a little at a
time, taking care never to let the earth rise
above the heart of the plant; and this earthing
up is repeated five or six times, at intervals
of about ten days or a fortnight, till the
plants are ready for use. Thus treated, a
single plant of celery of the solid kind has
been known to weigh nine pounds, and to
measure four feet in length.</p>

<p><i>Water cress</i> is generally gathered wild, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
it may be cultivated in gardens where there
is a clear running stream, on a sandy or
gravelly bottom. The plants are disposed in
rows parallel with the stream, about eighteen
inches apart, in shallow water; but four or
five feet apart if the water be very deep, as if
nearer together they will check the stream.
Thus treated, the plants may be cut at least
once a week during the whole summer. The
beds must, however, be cleared out and replanted
twice a-year; and when this is done,
all the plants are taken up, divided and
planted again in the gravelly bed of the
stream, a stone being laid on each to keep it
in its place.</p>

<p><i>Pot Herbs.</i>—Of these <i>parsley</i> is a hardy
biennial, a native of Sardinia, introduced
before 1548. It is generally sown in a drill
in February or March, and this will supply
leaves all the summer. The plants do not
seed till they are two years old. The curled
variety is preferred for garnishing. <i>Tarragon</i>
is a strong-smelling perennial from Siberia,
introduced before 1548. It is principally
used for making Tarragon vinegar. <i>Fennel</i>
is a perennial, which, when once introduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
spreads every where, and can scarcely be
eradicated. <i>Chervil</i> is an annual used for
garnishing, and sometimes in salads, and the
common <i>Marigold</i> is an annual, a native of
the South of Europe, introduced before 1573,
but now seldom grown except in cottage
gardens.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Herbs.</i>—These plants, though called
in gardening-books sweet herbs, are mostly
aromatic shrubs; such as thyme, sage, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Thyme.</i>—There are two kinds of this delicate
little shrub cultivated in gardens; the
common and the lemon: both are natives of
the south of Europe, and were introduced
before 1548. Young plants are generally
raised by division of the root, or from offsets
slipped off the branching roots in spring or
autumn; they grow best in poor dry soil, or
lime rubbish.</p>

<p><i>Sage</i> is a much taller-growing shrub than
thyme. It is a native of the south of Europe,
and was introduced before 1597. It
is propagated by slips, or by cuttings of
the young shoots taken off in May or June;
but as the plant is very long-lived it seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
wants renewing. It requires the same kind
of soil as thyme.</p>

<p><i>Mint.</i>—There are three kinds grown in
gardens: the common, or spear mint, which
is the kind boiled with peas, and used for
mint-sauce, &amp;c.; the peppermint, comparatively
little cultivated, and only used for distilling;
and the penny-royal. They are all
British perennials, and are propagated by
dividing the root, making cuttings, or taking
off offsets. All require rather a moist and
strong soil.</p>

<p><i>Marjoram.</i>—There are four kinds in cultivation:
the pot marjoram, which is a low
shrub, a native of Sicily, introduced in 1759,
and propagated by slips; the sweet, or knotted
marjoram, a hardy biennial, a native of
Portugal, introduced in 1573, and sown
every year from seed generally ripened in
France; the winter marjoram, a hardy perennial,
a native of Greece, introduced before
1640, and propagated by cuttings or
slips; and the common marjoram, a perennial,
and a native of Britain. The first
three kinds require a light dry soil, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the last a calcareous soil, and sheltered
situation.</p>

<p><i>Savoury and Basil.</i>—Winter savoury is
a hardy under-shrub, and summer savoury
an annual—both natives of the south of
Europe, and cultivated in England since
about 1650. Basil is an annual, a native
of the East Indies, introduced about 1548.
All these aromatic herbs may be purchased,
admirably dried, in small cases, at Mrs.
Johnson’s, in Covent Garden market.</p>

<p><i>Cucumbers</i> require a hotbed to grow them
to perfection; but the smaller kinds for
pickling are sometimes planted in the open
ground. The seed should be from two to
four years old, and it should be sown in
pots plunged in a hotbed, not below 58° at
night, nor above 65° in the day. When the
plants come up, they should be pricked out
into pots, three in each pot, and watered,
the earth in the pots and the water being
both previously kept under the glass for
some time, that they may be both of the
same heat as the plants. When the plants
are about five weeks old, they are generally
removed to a larger hotbed, with a two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
or three-light frame. In this bed, a little
ridge of earth is made under each light;
and, in each of these, the contents of a pot
is planted, without breaking the ball of earth
round the roots of the plants. The heat of
this bed is generally a little higher than that
of the seed-bed. Water should be given
every day, warmed to the heat of the bed.
If the plants are wanted to fruit early, the
ends of the shoots may be pinched off as
soon as the plants have made two rough
leaves, and this is called stopping the runners
at the first joint; this stopping is repeated
wherever the runners show a disposition
to extend themselves without producing
fruit. As plants raised under glass have not
the benefit either of currents of air or insects,
to convey the pollen of the barren plants to
the stigma of the fertile ones, the latter
must either be dusted with pollen by the
gardener, or the plants should be exposed
as much to the air as possible, in the middle
of the day, when it is warm enough, during
the time that they are in flower. Seeds for
the first crop of cucumbers are generally
sown in December or January; but, as extra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
heat and care are required at this early
season, the crop for a small garden may
be sown about March. The great art is
to grow the cucumbers long and straight,
and to keep them green, with a beautiful
bloom. For the first purpose, many cultivators
place a brick under the young fruit;
and for the latter they leave on the plant
abundance of leaves, and keep the ground
moist, as the plant appears to thrive best
when it has abundance of heat and moisture,
and is kept in the shade. A dry heat, and
especially exposure to the burning rays of
the sun, will make cucumbers flaccid and
yellow.</p>

<p><i>Pickling Cucumbers</i> are generally sown in
patches of ten or twelve seeds in each, in
the open air; and when they come up, they
are thinned out to four or five in each patch.
They are sown in rich ground, and well
watered; and as they grow, they are occasionally
earthed up.</p>

<p><i>Melons.</i>—The culture of the melon is the
same as that of the cucumber, except that
the lowest heat of the seed-bed should not
be less than 65°, and that of the fruiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
bed 75°. To grow the finer kinds of melons
well, however, requires the attention of a
regular gardener; and as this is the case also
with pine-apples (the plants of which are too
expensive to be trifled with), no directions
are here given respecting them.</p>

<p><i>Gourds.</i>—The two kinds of vegetable-marrow—the
American butter-squash, and the
mammoth-gourd, are excellent for the table,
either in soup, or boiled, or fried. The
plants of all these kinds should be raised in a
hotbed, the seeds being sown in March or
April, three in a pot, and covered nearly an
inch deep. In May, the young plants
should be removed to the open ground,
where they should be planted in rich soil,
and sheltered for a night or two, till they
have become inured to the change. They
should be frequently watered in dry weather,
as the fruit will not swell without abundance
of moisture.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes.</i>—The tomato or love-apple is
a tender annual, a native of South America,
introduced before 1596. The seeds should
be sown in a hot-bed in March, and as soon
as they come up pricked out into pots; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
should be transplanted into a warm border
in front of a south wall in May; where they
should be trained against the wall, or pegged
down over a warm bank of earth sloping to
the sun. They require abundance of water
while the fruit is swelling; and as much heat
as possible while it is ripening.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms.</i>—The spawn is generally procured
from a nurseryman; and the beds are
made of fresh horse-dung thrown together
in a heap under cover, and turned over many
times in the course of a fortnight or three
weeks, till every part has thoroughly fermented.
When the dung is thought to be
in a proper state, a trench is marked out
twelve or fourteen feet long and five broad,
and about six inches deep; the mould taken
out in forming it being laid on one side till
wanted. In the bottom of the trench there
should be a layer of long fresh stable manure
about four inches thick; and on this, successive
layers of the prepared dung, each beaten
flat with the fork, till the bed is about five
feet high, and narrow at the top like the
ridge of a house. In this state it may remain
about a fortnight; and then if the bed be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
found, on trying it by plunging a stick in, to
be not too hot, the bricks of spawn should be
broken into pieces about an inch and a half
or two inches square, and strewed regularly
over the bed, each piece of spawn being
buried by raising up a little of the dung and
inserting it. After this the surface of the
bed is beaten flat with a spade, and the whole
is covered with mould, that of a loamy nature
being preferred. The whole is then beaten
quite smooth, and covered about a foot thick
with oat straw, on which are laid mats. In
about a month or six weeks the mushrooms
will be ready for the table; and when
gathered they should be gently twisted up
by the roots, and not cut off, as the root, if
left in the ground, will decay, and be injurious
to the young plants.</p>

<p class="c less sp">THE KITCHEN-GARDEN CONTINUED—THE<br>
MANAGEMENT OF FRUIT TREES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> fruit trees in a kitchen garden are of
three kinds: the wall trees, the espaliers, and
the standards. To these may be added the
fruit shrubs, and the vines; which last are
generally grown under glass.</p>

<p><i>The Wall-Fruit Tree.</i>—There are two
things on which the welfare of wall-fruit trees
materially depends, viz. the construction of
the wall, and that of the border. The walls
of kitchen gardens are very generally made
too high: a serious fault in many respects,
but particularly in impeding the free passage
of the sun and air to the fruit. It has indeed
been found, by experience, that walls about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
eight feet high, will produce better fruit than
walls of ten feet or twelve feet, which is the
general height; and besides they have the
advantage of not throwing so deep a shadow
over the garden. Of whatever height the
walls may be, they should always be in
straight lines; as the various expedients
which have been from time to time adopted,
of curved or zigzag lines, have been found not
to answer in practice, but to produce eddies
and currents of wind exceedingly injurious
to the fruit. The garden wall should have a
slight stone coping; and where the trees are
likely to want protection, strong hooks, or
holdfasts, projecting from the wall, should be
built in at regular distances for the convenience
of suspending the mats or bunting
that may be employed; or supporting a deep
wooden coping. Hot or flued walls are not
desirable, as they are very expensive and
troublesome, and of very little use.</p>

<p><i>The walls should be built</i> on good, sound,
and deep foundations, but on no account on
arches; as it is of importance to the gardener
to confine the roots to the border in
front of the wall, which is under his control,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
instead of suffering them to spread through
the arches to the other sides, where they are
entirely removed from him.</p>

<p><i>The essential point to be attended to in the
construction of a fruit border</i> is that the soil
shall not be more than eighteen inches deep
on a hard bottom. If the subsoil be hard
gravel or rock, covered with mould to the
depth mentioned, nothing more can be desired;
but if the subsoil be wet clay, or sand
over gravel, or in short anything that will
allow of roots penetrating into it, artificial
means should be resorted to, to keep the
roots near the surface of the ground. The
most common method of forming a border is
to excavate the ground to the depth required,
and to pave the bottom of the excavation
with large stones or pebbles; but bricks,
cement, asphalt, or in short any other substance
may be employed which appears likely
to attain the end in view—taking care, however,
to provide effectual drainage, as otherwise
the chamber, as it is called, would become
a reservoir of stagnant water, exceedingly
injurious to the plants. The chamber
having been formed, it should be covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
with good rich garden mould to the requisite
depth, varying in some instances according
to the kind of tree to be grown in it; but in
all cases thoroughly pulverized, so as to offer
no obstruction to the passage of the roots.</p>

<p><i>When the trees are planted</i> care should be
taken to raise each on a little hillock, at the
point of junction between the trunk and the
root, to allow for the sinking of the ground.
The collar of a ligneous plant should never
be buried; as any moisture collected round
this tender and indeed vital part, brings on
canker, and innumerable other diseases. All
fruit-trees thus treated produce cankered
and deformed fruit, and die in a few years of
premature old age.</p>

<p>It can never be repeated too often that
the essential point in growing fruit-trees is
to keep their roots as near to the surface as
possible, and never to suffer them to descend
so deep as to be out of the influence of the
sun and air. Many persons unacquainted
with vegetable physiology, have an idea that
when a fruit-tree, which has been productive,
suddenly ceases to bear, it is because its
roots have reached the gravel, or in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
words, the subsoil. This is, however, false
reasoning on true premises. It is quite true
that the tree has ceased to bear in consequence
of the descent of its roots; but the
reason this descent is injurious is, that the
ground far below the surface is cold, and
frequently impregnated with stagnant water;
and either that the roots thus become swollen
and unable to perform their proper functions,
in which case the leaves turn yellow, and
the tree appears to wither, or that they
supply the tree with an abundance of poor
thin watery sap quite unsuitable for the production
of fruit. On the contrary, when the
roots are kept near the surface, though they
have no air-vessels except in the spongioles,
these spongioles imbibe air and carbonic acid
gas from the atmosphere with all the moisture
they take up; and thus the vessels are not
only kept in a healthy state by not being
overcharged with water without air, but the
sap is so thickened and enriched with the
carbonic acid gas, that it is brought into a
proper state for forming those deposits which
lead to the production of fruit.</p>

<p><i>The use of walls</i> is to afford tender plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the heat necessary to mature their fruit, by
reflecting the sun’s rays back upon it; and
by giving out to the fruit during the night
the heat they have absorbed during the day.
They are also useful in sheltering the plant
from cold winds; and in preventing the
branches from bruising each other in violent
storms. This being the use of walls, it is
evident that only those trees should be
trained against them that require protection;
and the south and south-east walls being
warmer than the others, it is equally evident
that only those trees should be trained
against these walls, that require a great deal
of heat to mature their fruits. There are
some fruits, such as the apple, which too
much heat renders mealy and insipid; and
these would obviously be injured instead of
improved by a south, or south-east wall;
while other fruits, such as the peach, could
not produce good fruit in our climate without
one. Before planting trees against the
walls of a garden, it will thus be necessary
to select the trees proper for each wall; and
as some of the finer kinds will be several
years before they attain a sufficient size to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
fill up the places assigned to them, trees of
inferior kinds may be planted between them,
so that no part of the wall may be lost—the
inferior trees being cut in as the others grow,
and being finally removed. This is accomplished
by planting alternately dwarf trees of
the kind which is to remain, and trees grafted
standard high, which are called riders, of the
kinds which are to be removed. The distance
at which the permanent trees ought to
be planted depends upon the nature of the
tree.</p>

<p>There is, however, one objection to a
south or south-east wall for tender plants
which should be carefully guarded against.
This is the danger from spring frosts, to
which the blossoms are exposed during the
night, from being brought prematurely forward
during the day. To guard against this,
the south wall should have a deep wooden
coping, supported by holdfasts, projecting
about a foot from the wall; and under this
coping there should be a row of hooks, on
which should be hung a kind of curtain of
bunting, which should be kept on day and
night in frosty weather, while the blossoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
are expanded. This is not only to protect
the blossoms from the frost, but to save them
from the withering effect of the sun, which
is as injurious to them after a frosty night as
the frost itself. In fact, when tender trees
are covered with hoar-frost, they may sometimes
be saved if shaded till they have
thawed; but they are always killed if exposed,
while the frost is on them, to the sun.
Bunting is preferable to matting or canvass;
because it is thinner and does not entirely
exclude the light and air, because it is more
easily put up and taken down, and takes up
less room when stowed away, and because it
is cheaper, four square yards costing only
two shillings at Edgington’s, the marquee-maker.</p>

<p><i>Kinds of Wall-Fruit Trees, &amp;c.</i>—The principal
fruits grown against a wall in England
are those containing stones; and of these the
most valuable are the peach, the nectarine,
and the apricot. The other stone fruits,
such as the plum and the cherry, are frequently
grown against a wall, but they are
grown also as standards: as are the kernel
fruits, such as the apple and pear; the apple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
being very rarely grown against a wall in
England. In the neighbourhood of London,
figs and grapes are grown against walls in
the open ground, and in some parts of Devonshire
the orange tribe.</p>

<p><i>Stone Fruits.</i>—All kinds of stone fruits are
more or less delicate at the time of forming
their stones, or “stoning” as it is called; and
the fruit requires thinning at that period to
prevent the greater part of it being dropped.
They all blossom early, and are delicate
while their flowers are expanded. For these
reasons their crops are more uncertain in a
variable climate like that of England, than
crops of the kernel fruits, and require more
care and attention to bring them to perfection.</p>

<p><i>Peaches and Nectarines.</i>—The peach and
the nectarine are only varieties of one species
of almond; and instances have been known
of peaches and nectarines growing on the
same tree without grafting. Both peaches
and nectarines are divided into two kinds;
the free stones, the flesh of which parts readily
from the stone—and the cling stones, the flesh
of which adheres to the stone. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
best peaches for a small garden are the Grosse
mignonne, Bellegarde, and Barrington. The
earliest peach is the red nutmeg, which
ripens in July; and one of the latest, the
Catherine, which does not ripen till October.
The best nectarines are the Elruge and the
Violette hative, with the new white nectarine,
for a variety in colour. Both peaches and
nectarines are budded on plum stocks, or on
seedling peaches, or almonds, the latter being
greatly preferred by the French nurserymen.
The best soil for peaches is about three parts
of fresh clayey loam, taken from some field,
and one part of drift sand. This soil should
be moderately enriched with vegetable mould
composed of decayed leaves, and it should be
laid on the prepared chamber to the depth
of about eighteen inches, rather less than
more. Peaches require rather an adhesive
soil, not too rich; as in a rich loose soil they
will produce wood rather than fruit. Peach
trees are seldom planted against the wall
where they are to remain, till they have been
two, three, or four years trained; and they
are generally removed at the latter end of
October, or beginning of November, just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the leaf begins to fall. They are best trained
in the fan manner; and as they always bear
their fruit on shoots of a year old, these
shoots must always be left on in pruning, and
the old wood cut out. Pruning should be
performed at two seasons, viz. winter and
summer: the winter pruning is performed
at the fall of the leaf, or in the beginning of
February, and consists of cutting out or
shortening the old wood or barren branches;
and summer pruning, which consists chiefly
of what is called disbudding, (that is, rubbing
off the buds as soon as they appear,) should
be applied to the removal of all shoots growing
right out from the wall, (and which, consequently,
could not be well trained,) or
which appear otherwise to be improperly
placed. Experienced gardeners also look
over the blossom buds, as soon as they show
themselves, and thin them out, without
allowing the tree to waste its strength in
forming fruit which it can never ripen, and
which is of no use in its green state. The
disbudding is easily performed; and watching
the trees to find when it will be necessary,
affords a constant source of interest. Thinning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the blossoms is rather more difficult;
but with a little practice, a lady could do it
much better than a gardener, as it is an
operation that depends principally on delicacy
of touch. When a peach tree is trained
in the fan manner, the first year the little
side shoots are left for producing the fruit,
and none of these should be more than a
year old. The next year these shoots must
be cut out, (as the same shoot never bears
two years in succession,) and others which
have been produced while they were bearing,
must be trained in their stead. The borders
should never be cropped on account of not
disturbing the roots, which should be encouraged
to rise up to the surface of the ground
by what is called mulching, that is, covering
the ground with straw, dead leaves, or litter;
and when this is objected to on account of
its untidy appearance, the borders should be
left bare, and only raked occasionally to prevent
the surface from caking over, and becoming
impervious to air and moisture. No
stable dung should be given to peaches, and
when the trees seem exhausted they should
be taken up and replanted in fresh soil; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
they should be removed, and trees of quite a
different kind, such as pears for example,
planted instead of them in the same soil.
When the borders cannot be spared to be left
entirely bare, a light crop, such as of spinach,
lettuces, mustard and cress, or parsley, should
be sown on them, and the remains of this
crop, when done with, should be raked off;
but fruit borders should never on any account
be touched with a spade, and even a fork
should be used very seldom and very sparingly;
never, indeed, unless the ground has
become too hard and compact to admit the
rain, the sun, and the air. It must never be
forgotten, that unless the spongioles of the
roots are permitted to imbibe the carbonic
acid gas always floating in the atmosphere,
with the moisture they take up, the sap of
the tree will never be rich enough to produce
fruit. The fruit and seeds of every plant are
in fact concentrations of carbon, precipitated
by the action of light; and where any plant
is deficient in carbon, or deprived of light, it
cannot produce much fruit. The culture of
the nectarine is exactly the same as that of
the peach. In both, when the season is cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
and wet, with but little sun, some cultivators
remove a few of the leaves to admit more air
and light to the fruit; but this should be
done very sparingly, as unless a sufficient
quantity of leaves are left to carry on the
proper circulation of the sap, the skin of the
fruit will become tough and withered, and
the flesh insipid. When the fruit is ripe, it
is customary, in large gardens, to suspend a
net under the branches to catch any fruit
that may fall, and thus to save it from being
bruised. The peach is supposed to be a
native of Persia, and to have been introduced
into England about the middle of the sixteenth
century. Peaches and nectarines on
a wall ten or twelve feet high, should be
planted about twenty feet apart; with riders
of some kind of plum, or peach, till the
permanent trees spread.</p>

<p><i>The Apricot</i> is a native of Armenia, introduced
about 1562. The culture is the same
as that of the peach, excepting that it is not
trained quite so much in the fan manner,
but somewhat horizontally. It also bears,
not only on the side-shoots of the last year,
but on close spurs formed on the two-years’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
old wood. The whole of the fruit is also
generally suffered to form, and is thinned
out while it is green, in May or the beginning
of June, as green apricots are generally
thought delicious in tarts. The best apricots
are the Moorpark for the table, and the
Breda for preserving. This last is frequently
grown as a standard. Large branches, or
rather arms of apricot-trees, particularly of
the Moorpark, are very apt to die off without
any apparent cause. The finest apricots I
ever saw were grown on a tree trained against
a cottage, the owner of which was an old
woman, who took in washing, and who was
in the habit, nearly every day, of pouring
down about the roots of the tree a quantity
of soap-suds. Apricot-trees should be twenty-five
feet apart, as the tree spreads rapidly,
and does not bear cutting in.</p>

<p><i>The Plum.</i>—No plum-tree, except perhaps
the green-gage, should be planted on a south
wall; and, as a north wall is too cold for
the finer kinds, they do best planted against
a wall facing to the east or west. Any common
garden soil will suit plum-trees; and
when the soil appears exhausted, it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
renovated by a little rotten dung laid on
the surface, and frequently watered to wash
its juices into the soil, without disturbing
the roots. Plum-trees bear on what are
called spurs, which are short rugged-looking
little branches, jutting out from the shoots
of two or three years’ growth. The same
spurs bear more than once, and often continue
fruitful several years. Plum-trees are
generally trained horizontally. The kinds
are very numerous, but the Green-gage and
Orleans are, perhaps, the most popular.
Plum-trees should be twenty feet apart, if
all dwarfs; but dwarfs and riders alternately
may be only fifteen feet apart.</p>

<p><i>The Cherry.</i>—Only the finer kinds of
cherries are grown against walls; and the
tree, in its native localities, delights in a
dry sandy soil, and elevated airy situation.
When cultivated, it will thrive in any common
garden soil which is tolerably open;
and it is not injured by manure applied
moderately, and in a perfectly rotten state.
The cherry is trained horizontally, and bears
on spurs springing from both the old and
the new wood. As the branches are continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
throwing out fresh spurs from their
extremities, it is a maxim with gardeners
never to shorten the bearing branches of a
cherry-tree. The morello is, however, an
exception to this rule, as its mode of bearing
resembles that of the peach; and it is always
pruned and trained like that tree. The
cherry-trees grown against walls are the
different varieties of May Duke, Circassian,
the large black Tartarian, the Morello, and
the Bigarreau. Cherries need not be more
than fifteen feet apart for the common kinds,
and twenty feet for the morello.</p>

<p><i>Fig-trees</i> grow and bear quite well in the
neighbourhood of London, and they even
thrive and bear in many street-gardens in the
City. The fig requires less care in training
and pruning than any other tree; it should
indeed rarely be touched with the knife, and
only the ill placed shoots removed by disbudding.
The fruit is produced on the
young wood at the extremity of the branches,
but it does not ripen till the wood on which
it grows is a year old. The best soil for figs
is a light fresh loam not above a foot or
fifteen inches deep, on a hard, well-drained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
bottom. This is essential; as the fig will
not grow with any stagnant water about its
roots, though it requires to be constantly
and abundantly supplied with moisture.
Many country persons throw soap-suds on
the roots of their fig-trees with very great
success. The tree may be trained in any
shape; and the long branches should be
bent backwards and forwards, not only to
make them throw out side-shoots, but to
cover the wall. The best figs for general
bearing are the black and brown Ischias and
the large blue or purple fig. A tree of the
last kind, which is trained against our house
at Bayswater, under the glass veranda, has
never failed, during the last ten years, to
produce a good crop every summer. Fig-trees
should be thirty feet apart if the branches
are trained horizontally; but they may be
placed rather nearer, if the branches are bent
backwards and forwards to cover the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Espaliers.</span>—Espaliers, though they are
nearly as troublesome to train as wall-trees,
have none of their advantages. They are
indeed only superior to standards in taking
up less room, in having a neater appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
in their fruit being more easily gathered, and
in their roots being more under the control
of the gardener. The latter is an important
advantage, and one of which every gardener
should avail himself. It has been already
observed, when speaking of the laying out of
a kitchen garden, that beyond the fruit-border
there is generally a walk, enclosing
the compartments devoted to culinary vegetables
in the centre. Now where espaliers
are grown, there should be a second chambered
border, exactly like the fruit border
under the wall, which should be shut out
from the culinary compartments by a low
wall under ground, or flat stones placed
edgeways, or boards, or, in fact, any thing to
prevent the roots of the espaliers from spreading
into the ground devoted to the culinary
crops. When due precautions have been
taken, the espaliers should be planted near
the boundary, and their roots carefully
spread out over the chambered border,
those parts being cut off which cannot be
brought to lie flat in the proper direction.
The ground is then pressed firmly upon the
roots, and espalier rails, either of iron or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
wood, are fixed near the trees to tie them
to. Espalier trees are seldom suffered to
grow higher than five feet or six feet, on
account of the trouble of training them
when they are of a greater height; but to
make amends for this loss of space, their
branches are allowed to spread as widely as
possible, according to the nature of the trees.
Thus apples should be planted thirty feet
apart, and cherries about the same distance;
pears thirty-five feet, and plums twenty-five
feet. The finer kinds of fruits are seldom
planted as espaliers; and apples and pears
are more commonly thus treated than cherries
and plums. The continual cutting
necessary to keep the trees in a proper shape
for training, and the unnatural position of
the roots, are indeed very unsuitable to trees
so apt to gum and canker as the cherry and
the plum. The width of the border destined
for the roots of the espaliers is generally five
feet; and it should only be cropped with a
few herbaceous or annual flowers, that will
not require the ground to be deeper stirred
than can be done with a rake. Some persons
suffer the roots of their espalier trees to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
extend under the gravel walks, which are
purposely left hollow; but this defeats the
purpose for which they are to be attracted to
the surface, for the spongioles will be as
effectually excluded from the air under a
compact coating of gravel, as if they were
buried many feet deep in the soil. If an underground
wall is built along the inner side of
the espalier border to confine the roots of the
trees, stones should be fixed in it at intervals,
with holes made in them for the reception of
the espalier rails, which should be run in
with pitch. These rails should be about
nine inches asunder, and they may be kept
together at the top with a transverse rail, to
which they should be nailed. The inconveniences
of espaliers are the very great trouble
of training them and keeping them within
bounds; the rough and untidy appearance
which their spurs assume when the trees
begin to get old; and the numerous diseases
to which the trees are liable, from their unnatural
position and constant cutting in,
and which always render espalier trees short-lived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Standard fruit-trees.</span>—Tall standard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
trees should never, on any account, be planted
in a kitchen-garden; as from their drip and
shade it is impossible to grow good culinary
vegetables under them; while, on the other
hand, the constant digging and trenching
necessary to cultivate culinary vegetables,
force the roots of the trees to descend so far
that it is impossible for them to produce
good fruit. Dwarf standards are, however,
by many preferred to espaliers; as they are
susceptible of all the advantages, without
any of the disadvantages attendant on that
mode of training. A chambered border may
be prepared for the dwarf standards in the
same manner as for the espaliers; and they
may be placed in the centre of it, instead of
on one side. The dwarf standards are generally
grafted very near the collar of the
plant, and are trained to form bushes rather
than trees, but in various manners. Some
are trained round a hoop placed inside, and
others have their branches trained upwards
for a few feet, and then bent downwards like
an umbrella; some are trained <i>en quenouille</i>,
with a single stem; others <i>en pyramide</i>; and
others have their branches spread out horizontally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
and supported by stakes placed at
a regular distance in a circle round the tree.
In short, there are no limits to fancy in this
respect. The trees generally grown in gardens
as dwarf standards are apples, pears,
and morello cherries. The other kinds of
cherries may also be grown in this manner;
but they are generally grown as tall standards
in a detached orchard near the kitchen-garden,
or adjoining the pleasure-grounds.
The common kinds of plums and damsons
are also grown as tall trees in the same manner,
as are the kitchen and keeping apples.
Mulberry-trees are generally planted on the
lawn, as well for the picturesque form of the
tree, as for the convenience of the fruit,
which drops as soon as it is ripe, and is
spoiled if it falls on dry earth or gravel.
Sweet chesnuts are grown in the park or
pleasure-grounds among other trees; and
walnuts in similar situations, or in a back-court,
or stable-yard, for the convenience of
their shade. Filberts and hazels are generally
planted on each side of a walk in the
garden or pleasure-ground, which they are
trained over; and barberries and elderberries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
in the shrubberies; the last four being the
only kinds of trees which should ever be
planted as standards in the slips to the
kitchen-garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Kernel fruits.</span>—The principal of these
are apples and pears, but the division also includes
the medlar, the quince, and the true
service.</p>

<p><i>The apple</i> is universally allowed to be the
most useful of all fruits; and it is certain
that there is no fruit more extensively cultivated.
The list of apples is as numerous as
that of peas; and it is almost as difficult to
make a selection from. Apples are, however,
generally divided into three kinds; the
dessert or eating apples, the kitchen or
baking apples, and the cider apples. The last
are good for nothing but to make cider, and
can never be mistaken; the line of demarcation
between the first two is, however, not
so strongly marked, as many of the kinds
will serve both purposes. Many dessert
apples, for example, possess the chief merit
of a good kitchen apple, viz. that of falling
well, or in plainer terms, of becoming quite
soft when baked or boiled; and many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
baking apples are very good to eat raw. The
Ribstone pippen, one of the best of all apples,
but rather a shy bearer, and the hawthorn
dean, a most abundant bearer, but an apple
that does not keep well, are both alike excellent
for the kitchen and the dessert. The
best keeping apple is the French crab, of
which some specimens have been preserved
quite fresh and plump for more than three
years.</p>

<p>The most common way of propagating
apple-trees is by grafting the best kinds on
crab-stocks, either standard high, that is, on
stocks suffered to grow to the height of about
six feet; or as dwarfs, that is, about six
inches or eight inches from the collar of the
stock. Sometimes trees intended to be
grown as dwarf standards in a kitchen-garden
are grafted what is called half standard
high; that is, about two or three feet
from the collar. When apple-trees are
planted in the kitchen-garden where they
are to remain, each tree should always be
placed on a little hillock; as no tree is more
liable to become cankered from having its
collar buried. The tree succeeds best in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
deep strong loam, provided it be well drained,
and rich rather than poor; and when the
soil appears exhausted, it may be renovated
by laying on it what the farmers call a top-dressing
of manure, taking care not to bury
or even to touch the collar of the tree.
Apple-trees will, however, flourish in any
soil except sand or gravel. They are very
apt to become cankered, and to be attacked
by the woolly aphis, sometimes called the
American blight. Canker is generally caused
by some defect in the drainage or the soil,
and of course no remedy can be efficacious
till the cause of the disease is removed;
when, however, the soil has been renovated
or drained, the effects of the disease may be
obviated by heading down the tree, when it
will produce new and healthy branches; or
cutting out the cankered part, if they should
be so low as to make it inconvenient to cut
off the trunk of the tree below them. The
American blight is best cured by brushing
the parts affected all over with soft soap and
water; and repeating the operation whenever
any fresh insects appear.</p>

<p><i>The Pear.</i>—The culture of the pear as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
standard differs very little from that of the
apple; and though it is naturally rather a
deeper-rooted plant, it requires its fibrous
roots to be kept near the surface. There is a
general complaint in gardens against pear-trees
as bad bearers, and very healthy-looking
trees have been known to exist twenty years in
a garden without ever even showing any blossoms.
Various causes have a tendency to produce
this effect. The pear being naturally
inclined to send down its roots, will do so,
unless effectually prevented by a chambered
border, or a hard rocky sub-soil; and if the
spongioles of the roots are allowed to descend
out of the reach of the air, the stagnant
moisture of the sub-soil will produce the
same effect on them as on those of the
apple. Planting pear-trees in a very rich
stiff soil has a similar effect. Injudicious
pruning, particularly in summer, is another
cause; as cutting in young shoots, while the
sap is in motion, has a tendency to make the
tree throw out two new shoots in the room of
every one removed, and thus to exhaust itself
in producing branches. Summer shoots
should either be checked by disbudding as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
soon as they appear, or suffered to remain
till winter, when they may be cut in, without
exciting the tree to fresh efforts to replace
them. Much of the fertility of pear-trees
also depends on the habit of the stock being
similar to that of the graft; and much also
on a judicious manner of training. As a
wall-tree, the pear is always trained horizontally,
and spurs are left on all the branches
for producing fruit. These spurs used formerly
to be left large, and standing out a
foot or eighteen inches from the wall; but
they are now found to bear best when kept
short. According to this plan, every spur is
allowed to bear only once, viz.—in its third
year; and after this, it is cut out to give
place to another spur, which has been trained
to succeed it. By this mode of treatment, a
constant succession of young spurs is kept
up, and fruit is produced all over the tree;
whereas, by the old method of pruning and
training, in the course of a few years, the
projecting spurs became barren, and fruit
was produced only at the extremity of the
branches. Pears are frequently grafted
standard high, when intended for training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
against a wall, in order that they may be
used as riders between dwarf plums or
peaches. Pear-trees generally bear better
as espaliers, or dwarf standards than against
a wall, and this has been attributed to rather
a curious reason. The stamens of the pear
have naturally very little farina; and where
the blossoms are exposed to great heat, and
have little air circulating round them, as is
the case with wall-trees, the pollen is very
apt to dry up without fertilizing the stigma.
The blossoms of espaliers and dwarf standards
are exposed to less heat and more air
than those of wall-trees; and thus their
pollen is more likely to perform its natural
functions. The truth of this observation
has been proved by shading the blossoms
of a wall pear-tree during the whole period
of their expansion, and fanning them with
an artificial current of air by means of bellows,
when it was found that more than twice
the usual quantity of fruit was produced.
Espalier pear-trees have generally a very
rough appearance, from their rugged projecting
spurs; but dwarf standards both look
and bear well. It has, however, been asserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
by some gardeners, that riders on the
walls, and tall standards in the orchard,
come into bearing earlier than dwarf standards,
unless the branches of the dwarfs are
suffered to grow very long, and are curiously
bent and twisted to produce depositions of
sap. Probably, however, the true cause of
the dwarf standards not bearing is, that, in
some cases, they have been planted in the
deep rich soil of the kitchen-garden, intended
for culinary vegetables; while the
trees in the orchard, compared with them,
were in poor light soil, and those against
the wall in a prepared border.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no fruit that has been so
much improved by cultivation as the pear;
and this extraordinary improvement has
been principally effected by the exertions
of Professor Van Mons of Louvain, near
Brussels. This gentleman, towards the latter
end of the last century, having turned
his attention to the culture of fruit-trees,
conceived the idea that new varieties of
pears might be raised scientifically; and the
result of his first experiment was that he
obtained four pears very superior to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
kinds previously known: these kinds were
the Passe Colmar, the Beurré Spence, the
Beurré de Ranz (commonly called the Beurré
Rance), and the Beurré d’hiver. Encouraged
by this success, the Baron Van Mons repeated
his experiments every year, and thus
raised above a hundred thousand new kinds
of pears; and though by far the greater part
of these proved in the end not worth growing,
many very valuable pears have been
obtained. Van Mons’s theory is to sow the
most perfect seed of the best pear of any
given sort that he can procure; then to
force the seedling as soon as possible into
fruit, and to sow the best seed it produces,
and thus to proceed till the fifth or sixth, or
tenth or twelfth generation. In this manner
coarse but highly-flavoured fruits were softened
down, and produced some of exquisite
flavour; and among others, the well-known
Marie Louise is said to have been the descendant,
in the fifteenth generation, of a
very coarse and harsh-flavoured parent. The
Glout morceau, one of the very best of the
Flemish pears, if kept till it is quite ripe,
is another variety, said to be similarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
descended; and the Duchesse d’Angoulême
a third.</p>

<p>The goodness of all these pears, however,
depends a great deal on the stocks
upon which they are grafted; and thus the
fruit produced does not always answer the
expectations of its growers. Another point
to be attended to is the thinning out of the
fruit, that more may not set than the tree
seems able to ripen, as, if the tree is suffered
to bear too large a crop, the fruit will be
small, hard, and without flavour.</p>

<p><i>The Quince</i> is a low tree which thrives
best near water. It is always grown as a
standard; and the fruit, which is very ornamental
when ripe, is never eaten raw. It
requires no particular care, except that of
planting it in a moist soft soil; and, if possible,
where its roots can have access to water.
There are four or five kinds grown in nurseries,
but they differ very little from each
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Miscellaneous Fruit Trees.</span>—Under
this head I shall include all those trees usually
grown as standards in pleasure grounds or
orchards; but which, as their fruit is eaten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
appear properly to belong to the department
of the kitchen-garden.</p>

<p><i>The Medlar.</i>—There are three or four
kinds of medlars, one of which is much
larger than the others. The medlar will
thrive in any soil or situation not too dry;
but, like the quince, does best within the
reach of water. The fruit, which is never
eaten till it is in a state of decay, is not of
much value, but the flowers are very large
and rather handsome.</p>

<p><i>The Mulberry.</i>—There are three distinct
species of mulberry, besides innumerable
varieties. The distinct species are the white,
only used for feeding silk-worms with its
leaves; the black, which is generally grown
in gardens for its fruit; and the red, or
American mulberry. Many persons are not
aware of the difference between the black
and the white mulberries, and they think
that if they have a mulberry tree in their
garden, they cannot do better than feed their
silk-worms with its leaves; though the fact
is that the white mulberry is scarcely ever
grown in England, and the leaves of the
black mulberry are positively injurious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
the worms. Lettuce leaves are indeed better
than any other food for silk-worms reared in
England. The fruit of the red mulberry is
eatable, but not very good; and its leaves
are injurious to silkworms.</p>

<p>The black mulberry is said to be a native
of Persia; but if so it must have been brought
to Europe at a very early period, as it was
common in Italy when ancient Rome was at
her zenith. It appears to have been introduced
into England long before 1573, as
some old trees, still in existence, are said to
have been of considerable size in that year.
The mulberry has several peculiarities in its
habits, which distinguish it from most other
trees. The most striking of these is that it
may be propagated by truncheons: that is,
if a large limb of a tree, as thick as a man’s
arm or thicker, be cut off, and stuck into the
ground, it will grow without any further
trouble being taken with it; and probably
the next year, or the year after, it will bear
abundance of fruit. This I believe is the
case with no other tree except the olive.
The mulberry also is later than any other
tree in coming into leaf; but when it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
begin to open its buds, its leaves are expanded,
and its young fruit formed, in an
incredibly short time. Another peculiarity
is that old trees frequently split into five or
six different parts, each of which in time
becomes surrounded with bark, so that a very
old and thick trunk appears changed into
five or six slender new ones: the branches
also, if they lie along the ground, take root
and become trees; and if an old mulberry
tree be blown down, every branch sends
down roots into the ground, and in a very
short time becomes a tree. When apparently
dead, a mulberry may in most cases be resuscitated
by cutting it down to just above the
collar, when it will send up a number of
young stems, which will very soon be covered
with fruit. The mulberry, in other respects,
needs very little care from the gardener; it
requires no pruning; and even the fruit does
not require gathering, as it drops as soon as
it is ripe.</p>

<p><i>The Elder</i> is rather a shrub than a tree;
and from its very disagreeable smell, and
straggling habit of growth, it is rarely planted
except in cottage gardens. There are several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
kinds, one with white berries, another
with green, and a third, which is very ornamental,
with scarlet berries. There is also a
very handsome kind with cut leaves: a ptisan
made of the flowers is reckoned excellent in
France for producing perspiration in cases of
colds and fevers; and the fruit of the blackberried
kind is used for making wine, and
also a kind of jam.</p>

<p><i>The Pomegranate.</i>—If the elder be considered
a plebeian fruit, the pomegranate
may be called an aristocratic one, as it is
rarely seen in England except in the gardens
of persons of rank and wealth. Notwithstanding
this, it requires but little care from
the gardener, and it is only necessary for him
to spare the knife; since it is on the points of
the shoots, and on short slender twigs projecting
from the branches, which are exactly
what a gardener, whose only care was to
make his tree look neat, would think it advisable
to cut off, that flowers are produced.
Pomegranates require very rich and well
pulverised soil, and to be trained against a
wall with a south, or south-east aspect. When
it is wished to throw them into fruit, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
blossoms should be shaded during the whole
time of their expansion.</p>

<p><i>Nut Trees.</i>—The principal kinds of nut
trees cultivated in British gardens are, the
walnut, the sweet chestnut, and the filbert.
The American hickories and the black walnut
are sometimes grown, though but rarely;
as are the Colurna and other nuts. The
almond also, as it is grown only for the kernel
of its stones, may be classed among the nuts,
though it is, properly speaking, a kind of
peach.</p>

<p><i>The Walnut</i> can hardly be mentioned
without bringing with it a host of classical
recollections. The Greeks dedicated this
tree to Diana, and held fêtes under its shade;
and the Romans called its fruit the nut of
Jove. In modern times its wood has obtained
rather an unpleasant kind of celebrity, as
being generally used for making the stocks
of muskets. In villages and country places,
however, the walnut recals more agreeable
associations; as its noble leaves and spreading
branches render it a delightful tree for shade;
and formerly it used to be frequently found
at the doors of cottages and farm houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>There are several kinds of walnut-trees
cultivated for their fruit; all varieties of one
species, and differing principally in the hardness
or comparative softness of their shells.
Walnut-trees are generally propagated by
sowing the nuts; and if the young trees are
planted in a light, sandy, and well-drained
soil, they will grow rapidly, and bear at an
early age.</p>

<p>The custom which prevails among the
country people in some parts of England
and France, of beating a barren walnut-tree
to make it bear, is efficacious, as the beating
breaks off the points of the too luxuriant
shoots, and makes them send out those short
spurs which alone produce fruit; though the
end would be attained with more certainty
by pruning. A decoction of walnut-leaves
and husks is said to be very efficacious in
protecting plants against insects, if sprinkled
on the leaves.</p>

<p>The nut of the black walnut (Juglans
nigra) is so hard as to be of little use for the
table; and only two or three of those of the
hickories can be considered as fruit. The
best of these is the peccane nut (Carya olivæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
formis), of which Washington is said to have
been so fond that he was rarely without some
in his pocket, which he used to be continually
eating during his campaigns. The
white hiccory (Carya sulcata), the outer
rind of which is very thick, is also good to
eat.</p>

<p><i>The sweet chestnut</i> is frequently called the
Spanish chestnut, because the best sweet
chestnuts were formerly brought to the London
markets from Spain. The tree can, indeed,
scarcely be considered as an English
fruit-tree; though some of the chestnuts sold
for the table are grown in Devonshire. In
France, chestnut-trees are more common;
and they are divided there into two kinds:
the chataigniers and the marroniers; the
former bearing about the same relation to
the latter as the crab does to the apple. The
best chestnuts in France are those called les
marrons de Lyons. The sweet chestnut is a
native of Asia; but it has also been found
in the north of Africa and North America.
It is always propagated by seeds, and thrives
best in a deep sandy loam; it will grow in
even the poorest gravel, but it never does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
well in either a calcareous soil, or a stiff
clay.</p>

<p>There are several celebrated chestnut-trees
of enormous size and great age; the most
remarkable of which are the Castagna di
Cento Cavalli on Mount Etna, and the Tortworth
chestnut in England. Till within the
last eight or ten years it was believed that
the wood of the chestnut was good timber;
but it has lately been discovered that it is
absolutely worthless, except while quite
young: the wood that was supposed to be
chestnut, having been proved to be that of
the English chestnut oak (Quercus sessiliflora).
The wood of the chestnut, when the
tree attains a large size, becomes what the
English timber-merchants call shaky, and
what the French call dialled; that is, instead
of forming a solid log of timber, the trunk
when cut down is found to fly off in splinters,
or to divide into a number of angular pieces,
as if shivered by a blow from the centre.</p>

<p><i>The filbert</i> is only a variety of the common
hazel; and it is supposed to derive its name
from the words “full beard,” in allusion to
the length of its husk. The varieties of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
hazel are indeed divided into two classes:
those with long husks which are called the
filberts; and those with short husks which
are called the nuts. All the varieties grow
best in calcareous soils, like those of Kent;
in which county the best nuts grown in
England are raised. When either filberts or
nuts are grown in gardens they are generally
planted in rows from five feet to ten feet
apart from each other in the row, according
as they are wanted to grow high, or to
spread. Filberts are generally propagated
by sowing the seeds, and nuts by suckers,
which the trees throw up in abundance.
“The principal art in the culture of the
filbert as a fruit-tree,” says Mr. Loudon in
his <i>Arboretum Britannicum</i>, “consists in
training and pruning it properly, as the
blossom is produced upon the sides and
extremities of the upper young branches,
and from small young shoots which proceed
from the bases of side branches, cut off the
preceding year. The tree requires to be
kept remarkably open, in order that the
main branches may produce young wood
throughout the whole of their length. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
filbert orchards about Maidstone, the trees
are trained with short stems like gooseberry-bushes,
and are formed into the shape of a
punch-bowl, exceedingly thin of wood.”
When the trees are pruned, care is taken to
eradicate all the suckers. Filberts are always
kept in their husks, and if they lose their
colour and appear black or mouldy, their
appearance is renovated by the dealers, by
putting them into iron trays pierced with
holes, and gently shaking them over a chafing-dish
full of charcoal, on which a little powdered
sulphur has been thrown while the
charcoal was red-hot.</p>

<p><i>The Constantinople nut</i>, or Colurna hazel, is
a large handsome tree, and the American
hazels are shrubs grown occasionally in
plantations, but not cultivated in England
for their fruit.</p>

<p><i>The almond</i> is in fact a peach-tree, with a
fruit having a leathery pericardium instead
of a fleshy one; and what are called almonds
are the kernels of the stones of this fruit.
The bitter and sweet almonds are varieties
of the same species; and there are several
other varieties differing principally in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
degree of hardness of the stone. The other
part of the fruit is in all the varieties quite
worthless; except for the prussic acid it
contains. The prussic acid used in medicine
is, however, made principally from the kernel
of the bitter almond, though it does not
exist in that of the sweet variety. Almond-trees
are propagated by grafting either on
almond or plum-stocks; they are frequently
planted for the beauty of their flowers, which
appear before the leaves, but they are seldom
grown in England for their fruit; most of
the almonds sold in London being imported
from Italy or Spain. The Jordan almonds,
which are considered the best, are brought
from Malaga. The almond requires a dry
soil, either sandy or calcareous; and the
situation should be sheltered, as the branches
are brittle and apt to be broken off by high
winds. When the stones are sown, care
should be taken to press the sharp ends
downwards. The young plants will not
bear transplanting, as they will send down
tap-roots two feet long the first season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Fruit-shrubs.</span>—The principal fruit-shrubs
grown in gardens are gooseberries, currants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
and raspberries; to which may be added
barberries and cranberries.</p>

<p><i>The gooseberry.</i>—The number of varieties
of this useful fruit almost exceeds belief, and
fresh kinds are originated every year. The
principal reason of the great number of
gooseberries thus raised may be traced to
the gooseberry shows now so prevalent in
different parts of the kingdom. At these
shows the largest and heaviest berries gain
the prize; and it thus becomes an object
with the exhibitors to grow berries that shall
be as large and as heavy as possible. For
this purpose they raise a great many new
kinds; and when they have obtained one
likely to suit their purpose, they plant it
in very rich soil, water it well, and picking
off all the berries except three or four, they
nourish these by putting saucers filled with
water under each. By these cares gooseberries
have been produced weighing above an
ounce and a half each; and one weighing
very nearly two ounces; though gooseberries
generally, even of large size, seldom weigh
above half an ounce.</p>

<p>Gooseberries may be propagated either by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
seeds or cuttings; and they will thrive in any
good garden soil, if it be well drained, well
manured, and not under the drip of trees.
When gooseberries are wanted large, the
ground between the rows should have a coating
of rotten manure laid on it every third year.
Gooseberry-bushes are generally planted in
rows, the rows eight or ten feet apart, and the
bushes six feet from each other in the rows.
They are pruned twice a-year: in winter to
remove the branches not likely to produce
fruit; and in summer to clear away the cross
shoots which shade the fruit from the sun,
and prevent the access of air to every part of
the tree. It is a very good plan to thin the
fruit; which is easily done when gathering
green gooseberries for pies and puddings, by
taking a few from every branch and never
gathering from the same tree twice. The
gooseberry bush produces fruit both on the
old and young wood; but in the summer
pruning all the long slender shoots which
the tree sends out beyond the part which
produces fruit should be cut off, to prevent
the plant from wasting its strength. The best
red gooseberries for general use are perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
the following: the Warrington, which is a
great bearer, and retains its fruit a long time
on the tree; the Champagne, an early gooseberry
of very fine flavour; the early Rough-Red,
small, but remarkable for its sweetness;
the Roaring-Lion, the largest gooseberry
grown, a good bearer, the berries of which
are oblong, and have a smooth skin; the
Ironmonger, the fruit of which is almost
black; the Crown-Bob, a very large gooseberry,
equally good for using green or ripe;
and the Top-Sawyer, a large, round and
rough gooseberry, with a very thin skin, and
agreeable flavour. The best white gooseberries,
are the White Dutch, the Whitesmith,
Wellington’s Glory, and the Cheshire
Lass, the last two being of very large size;
the best yellow are Rumbullion, and Rockwood,
the first of which is reckoned the best
of all gooseberries for preserving; and the
best green are Ocean, a large early gooseberry,
and the Pitmaston Greengage, a late
variety, remarkable for its extraordinary
sweetness, and for its hanging on the tree
till killed by frost.</p>

<p><i>Currants</i> are very seldom raised from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
seed; as there is no particular desire for the
production of new sorts. The usual mode of
propagation is by cuttings, which are taken
off the strongest shoots in autumn or early in
spring, and planted in rich soil. The cuttings
are generally about a foot long; and
all the buds are taken off except five or six
at the top: the cutting is then firmly inserted
in the soil about six inches deep.
No other care is required but pruning the
young trees every year. The currant bears
on spurs of the old and new wood; and as
currant-trees, when pruned, are generally
cut into these spurs, a currant-bush after its
winter pruning looks like a worthless stump,
fit only for the fire. The currant is very
hardy, and will grow in any soil or situation,
even under the drip of trees. In open
situations and rich soils, currants have been
grown to a very large size; but not proportionately
large to gooseberries. The red,
white, and striped currants are varieties of
the same species; but the black is another
species. All belong to the same genus as
the gooseberry.</p>

<p><i>Raspberries</i> are, what are called, travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
plants; that is to say, if left to themselves,
they would, by the old plants dying off, and
being succeeded by suckers every year, soon
travel over a considerable extent of ground.
The raspberry thrives best in a light, free
loam, moderately rich; and in an open situation.
It always bears on the young shoots,
so that the principal art required in pruning
it consists in cutting out the old wood, and
shortening the young. The height at which
the bearing shoots should be left is three
feet, or four feet. The best raspberries are
the red and yellow Antwerp. Raspberries
are propagated by suckers, which are produced
in great abundance every year. The
raspberry belongs to the same genus as the
bramble, or blackberry.</p>

<p><i>Barberries.</i>—No fruit-tree or shrub requires
less care in its culture than the barberry,
or, as it is more properly called, the
berberry. The sorts usually grown for their
fruit are all varieties of the common sort:
they are the common red, the stoneless, and
the sweet. Several varieties of the Mahonia
or Ash berberry bear excellent fruit, but the
trees are at present too rare, and of too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
high a price, to be cultivated for that purpose.
The berberry will grow in any soil
and situation, and it does not require any
pruning.</p>

<p><i>The Cranberry</i> will only grow in moist
soil, or peat earth. It succeeds very well on
the muddy margin of a pond; particularly if
a row of stakes be driven into the water two
or three feet from the edge, and lined with
stones, on which is laid a quantity of bog
earth. In this earth the cranberries are
planted, and they will require no after-care
except the occasional trimming into shape of
their long runners. The common cranberry
is a native of England, Scotland, and indeed
of all the north of Europe; but its fruit is
much smaller than that of the American
cranberry, which has also a more delicate
flavour.</p>

<p class="c less sp">THE FLOWER-GARDEN, AND THE CULTURE<br>
OF FLOWERS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Whatever</span> doubts may be entertained as to
the practicability of a lady attending to the
culture of culinary vegetables and fruit-trees,
none can exist respecting her management
of the flower-garden, as that is pre-eminently
a woman’s department. The culture of
flowers implies the lightest possible kind
of garden labour; only, indeed, enough to
give an interest in its effects. This light
labour is, in fact, one of the reasons that the
culture of flowers is so generally a favourite
occupation; as, though it is one of the
conditions of our nature that we shall never
enjoy what is too easily obtained, it is equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
true that we cannot associate the ideas of
pleasure with anything that gives us very
much trouble. The culture of flowers is
exactly in the happy medium between what
is too hard and what is too easy. There are
difficulties in it, but they are such as may be
readily surmounted; and the result at once
gratifies our own sense of what is beautiful,
and our pride at being the means of presenting,
so much that is worthy to be admired,
to others.</p>

<p><i>Laying out a Flower-Garden.</i>—Very little
need be said of the aspect of the flower-garden,
as, in most cases, it depends on
circumstances quite beyond the control of
the cultivator of flowers: when, however, a
situation can be chosen, the best is one open
to the south or south-east, and sheltered on
the north. It must be observed, however,
in all situations, that flowers never do well
under the shade of trees. Where no ground
can be spared for a flower-garden but a spot
surrounded by tall trees, it is better to give
up at once the idea of growing flowers in it
in beds, and to ornament it with rock-work,
fountains, vases, statues, &amp;c., interspersed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
with a few flowering trees and shrubs, so
arranged, that though their flowers, if produced,
would augment the beauty of the
scene, the want of them may not destroy it,
if they should fail. Flower-gardens are of
two kinds,—those that are called natural,
and which are planted without any regard to
regularity, and those that are called geometrical,
and which consist of beds forming
some definite figure.</p>

<p>The natural, or English style, as it is
called abroad, however beautiful it may be
in pleasure-grounds, is very ill adapted to a
flower-garden, which is essentially artificial.
The principal beauty of a flower-garden
consists, indeed, in the elegance with which
it has been arranged, and the neatness with
which it is kept; or, in other words, in the
evidence it affords of the art that has been
employed in forming it. This being the
case, it is quite clear that an artificial mode
of arrangement is more suitable to it than
any other, as it is best adapted for keeping
up the harmony of the whole. In all cases,
therefore, where the garden is large enough
to show a formal figure to advantage, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
artificial mode of arrangement should be
adopted; and wherever it is adopted, the
beds should be planted so as to form masses
of different-coloured flowers. Where, however,
the garden is very small, and no part
of it can be set entirely apart for flowers, no
attempt should be made to produce masses
of colour in regular forms; but the plants
should be arranged along the borders singly,
or in patches, as may be best adapted to
display the individual beauties of each. In
some cases, flowers may be planted in borders,
so as to form a miniature representation
of the natural system: as, for instance,
first there may be planted anemones and
ranunculuses, interspersed with patches of
Flos Adonis, larkspurs, &amp;c. to come into flower
when the anemones and ranunculuses have
done flowering; next should be some poppies
and fumitories; and next, stocks and
wall-flowers. In this manner, the beds might
be arranged, by mixing perennials and annuals,
so as to form an ornamental botanic
garden during the whole of the flowering
season; and the flower-garden would thus
become not merely a source of elegant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
amusement, but also actually of scientific
knowledge, without any appearance of formal
arrangement.</p>

<p>When the flower-garden is to be a geometrical
one, the best way of designing it is
to draw a figure on paper consisting of angular,
circular, or serpentine forms, to represent
beds, and arranging them so as to form
a whole. This may appear easy at first, but
to do it well, requires a great deal of both
taste and ingenuity; as each form should
not only harmonize well with the others, but
be handsome in itself. Where the space to
be laid out is small, the figure may be more
complex, and the separate beds more grotesque
in their shapes, than where the garden
is large: but where a large space is devoted
to flowers, only simply formed beds
should be adopted. The reason for this is,
that where the beds are of bizarre shapes,
they require to be seen at one <i>coup-d’œil</i> to
have a good effect; whereas simple and uniform
shapes may be seen either together or
alone, without producing any disagreeable
impression on the mind. Thus, in large
flower-gardens, a succession of circles or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
ovals at regular distances, so as to form continually
changing vistas to the spectator who
walks through them, will have a much better
effect than any geometric figure, the parts
composing which appear ridiculous when
disjointed. Whatever figures may be adopted,
as soon as they have been sketched on
paper, each bed should be coloured; to try
what arrangement of colours will be best
suited to the form of the beds, &amp;c. The
colours, of course, should be those usually
found in flowers: for example, yellow, scarlet,
blue, pink, orange, and purple; and they
should be arranged, not only with a view
to effect, but with regard to the practicability
of filling the beds with suitable flowers.
The colours above mentioned may, however,
generally be procured, and a bed of white
flowers may be added at pleasure wherever
it may appear necessary.</p>

<p>The forms of the beds having been decided
on, the next step is to mark them on
the ground, and this is done in several
different ways. One is by covering the
figure with squares, and then forming much
larger squares with pack-thread over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
ground; that part of the outline of the figure
contained in each of the small squares is
then to be transferred to the corresponding
large square, by tracing it on the ground
with the point of a stick. When the pattern
is regular, it is sometimes marked on the
ground by stretching a garden-line from one
point to another by means of pegs. When
this line is so arranged as to form the proper
figure, it is chalked, and made to thrill between
the pegs, so as to transfer the chalk in
the proper lines to the ground. When circles
are to be traced, it is done by first fixing
a stake in the centre, and then forming a
loop at the end of a cord, and putting it over
the stake. One end of the cord being thus
fastened to the stake, the other end should
be stretched out to the extremity of the
radius or half-diameter of the circle, and a
short pointed stick should be tied to it, with
which, the circle may be traced all round.
An oval is made by tracing two circles, the
outer edge of one of which just touches the
centre of the other; a short line is then
drawn at the top, and another at the bottom,
and this, when the central lines are obliterated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
forms the oval. Many other ways
will suggest themselves, and may be adopted:
the essential points in all being to have
the ground first dug, and made perfectly
smooth and level; and then to have the
figure clearly and accurately traced out and
tested by measurement, before any of the
beds are formed, or the turf or gravel laid
down.</p>

<p>Planting the beds and forming the walks
require nearly as much care as tracing out
the figure. Many persons, however, are not
aware of this: they think, if the figure be
good and accurately traced on the ground,
that nothing more will be required; or, if
any thing more be necessary, it is only to
indicate the proper colours of the beds to the
gardener.</p>

<p>This, however, is not enough; low plants
producing abundance of flowers must be
chosen, and these must be carefully trained,
or pegged down, so as to cover the beds
entirely, or the effect will be destroyed. If,
for example, a bed of scarlet be wanted, a
lady would probably think that her gardener
would have no trouble in finding abundance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
of scarlet flowers; and having told him the
colour, she would give herself no further
trouble. Now the kind of scarlet flower to
be used, depends entirely on the position of
the bed, and the kinds of flowers used in the
other beds. If these flowers have been
dwarfs, and trained so as entirely to cover
the ground, the scarlet flower used, should
be the verbena melindres, (or chamdrifolia
as it is now called,) or some of its varieties,
and each stem should be pegged down close
to the ground. Thus treated, and supplied
with abundance of water, being grown in
rich light soil, on a porous subsoil or well
drained, the verbena will soon become a
splendid mass of scarlet, almost too dazzling
for the eye to bear, unless it be relieved by
grass walks between the beds. If, on the contrary,
the bed in question had been planted
with one of the scarlet lobelias, or even
scarlet geraniums, the effect would have been
quite different, from the taller growth of the
plants, and the greater proportion of leaves
to their flowers. Where geraniums are
grown to produce an effect in beds, the
plants should be kept bushy while in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
green-house or frame, by continually shifting
them into larger pots, or frequently taking
off the points of their shoots; and when
planted out, they should be at least a foot or
eighteen inches asunder, increasing the distance,
if the plants are very large. The
kind should be the Frogmore or Dropmore
varieties; and the plants should be well
watered, and frequently pruned wherever
they throw up long shoots. Other plants
should be treated in a similar manner; and
great care should be taken to keep all the
plants in the beds which are to combine to
form a figure, of the same height, and equally
covered with flowers. The centre bed alone
may have taller plants. Where the walks
are of gravel, a greater proportion of leaves
may be allowed to the flowers; but a geometrical
flower-garden never looks half so well
on gravel as on grass.</p>

<p>The walks of a geometrical flower-garden,
if of grass, may be laid down with turf, or
sown with grass seeds; and in either case
they should never be pared (as that would
enlarge the beds, and destroy their proportion
to the walks), unless some part should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
accidentally project into the bed, when it
should be removed, and the turf pressed
down so as to form the same gradual slope
from the bed to the walk as in the other
part. Where the walks are of gravel, the
beds should have a neat edging of box, or
any other plant that may be preferred, kept
quite low and narrow, by frequent pruning,
but which should never be clipped.</p>

<p><i>The Culture of Flowers.</i>—The ornamental
flowers grown in gardens may be all arranged
under the heads of annuals, biennials, perennials,
bulbs, tubers, corms, flowering dwarf
shrubs, climbers, twiners, trailers, and rock
plants; and as the culture of the plants in
each division is nearly the same, I shall say
a few words on each, particularizing those
plants which require a different treatment
from the ordinary routine of their kind.</p>

<p><i>Annuals.</i>—Most of the hardy annual flowers
should be sown in March, April, or May, in
the open border where they are intended to
remain. The usual method of sowing in the
borders, is, first to loosen the ground with a
fork, and to break it very fine; after which
it should be made perfectly level, and raked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
A circle is then made by pressing the bottom
of a flower-pot saucer, three or four inches in
diameter, on the ground; and six or eight
seeds are spread over the level surface thus
formed: a little soil is then sprinkled over
them, and the surface slightly pressed again
with the saucer. If the weather, or the soil
be dry, a slight watering should be given to
the seeds after sowing, with a watering-pot
having a very fine rose; but this must be
done carefully, as too much water would
wash the seeds out of their place. It is usual,
after sowing, to stick a flat stick into the
ground in the centre of the patch with the
name of the flower upon it; and it is better
to write these names very plainly, with a
rather soft black-lead pencil than with ink,
as the ink is very apt to run, and to render the
words indistinct. Very neat little tallies,
called monogrammes, made of very smooth
wood, and prepared for writing on, are sold
at the principal seed shops. It is customary
with many gardeners, after sowing flower
seeds, to turn a flower-pot over them; and
this practice is useful in keeping the seeds
moist by preventing evaporation, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
hole in the bottom of the pot admits enough
light and air for germination. The flower-pot
should, however, be removed as soon as
the young plants appear above ground;
as if kept on longer, the plants would be
drawn up, and their stems would become so
elongated, and consequently so weak, that
they would never recover their strength or
beauty. Flowering plants should always be
kept dwarf and compact; not only on account
of the superior neatness of their appearance,
but because tall, ill-grown plants never produce
fine flowers. For this reason, as soon
as annuals attain their second pair of leaves
they should be thinned out; and again, when
about a foot high, if necessary. As the
plants grow they should be watered occasionally;
and when of a proper height, staked
and tied up, if of a kind to require support.
As soon as the flowers fade they should be
cut off; unless, as is sometimes the case, the
plant has very ornamental seed pods, in
which case they may be left on. It is seldom
worth while for any lady to save her own
seed; but when she does so, the plants for
that purpose should be grown in a back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
garden or reserve-ground, as they greatly
disfigure a flower-garden. All annuals, indeed,
should be taken up, and carried to
the refuse heap as soon as they cease to
be ornamental; as in their withered state,
they only call up unpleasant images in the
mind.</p>

<p>Tender annuals are raised on a hot-bed,
and though generally sown in February, are
not planted in the open ground till May.
When they have been raised in pots, the contents
of each pot should be carefully turned
out, and put into a hole made to receive
them without breaking the ball of earth that
has formed round the roots of the plants.
As some plants, as for example stocks, and
all the cruciferæ, require a rich soil, a hole
may be dug in the border a foot or eighteen
inches in diameter, and about the same
depth, and filled with a rich compost of
equal parts of garden mould, decayed leaves,
and well rotted manure, or what is much
better, with either the remains of the trenches
in which celery was grown the preceding
summer, or the earth used in covering, or
that laid round, manure while fermenting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
a hot-bed. The hole should be filled with
this compost, so as to raise it about six
inches higher than the rest of the border, to
allow for the new earth sinking, and the
annuals should be planted in the centre, and
carefully shaded for a few days by a flower-pot
being turned over them. The mode of
making and managing a hot-bed has been
already given in the second chapter of this
work; but the readiest way for the inhabitants
of a suburban villa to obtain half-hardy
annuals, is to purchase them from some
nurseryman when ready for transplanting.
The usual price is from two-pence to four-pence
for a dozen plants; and thus, for a
couple of shillings, a sufficient number of
plants may be procured to make a splendid
display for a whole summer. No one should,
indeed, attempt to manage a hot-bed, who
has not some person to pay constant attention
to it; as one day’s neglect respecting
giving air, watering, &amp;c. will often destroy
the hopes of a whole season.</p>

<p>The Californian annuals require peculiar
treatment. These plants are very hardy,
and though many of them are of short duration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
in flower, they may, by proper management,
be contrived to produce a brilliant
effect during the whole summer. For this
purpose a well-trodden path, or a piece of
very hard ground, should be covered about
an inch thick with very light rich soil; and
the seeds of any of the Californian annuals
should be sown in it. These will stand the
winter, and in February or March, when the
flower-beds have been dug over, and made
quite smooth, the annuals should be taken
up with the spade in patches and laid on
the bed; the spaces between the patches
being filled up with soil, and the whole
made quite firm and compact, by beating
each patch down with the back of the spade.
As soon as the patches have been removed,
fresh earth should be spread on the hard
ground, and fresh seeds sown in it, the
plants springing from which will be ready to
transfer to the beds as soon as the first series
have done flowering; and in this way a succession
of flowers may be kept up nearly all
the year, observing to dig over the bed in
the flower-garden to which the flowers are
to be transplanted, and to rake it smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
every time the old flowers are removed, in
order to prepare it for the new ones.</p>

<p><i>Biennials</i> are plants which do not flower
till the second year. They are generally
sown in March, April, or May, and are
transplanted in September, to the situations
where they are to flower the following year.
The best known of these flowers are the
different kinds of hollyhock, snapdragon,
Canterbury bells, wallflowers, sweet-williams,
Œnotheras, and Brompton stocks; but there
are many others extremely beautiful and
equally well deserving of cultivation. Most
of the biennials may be propagated by layers
or cuttings, and thus treated, they will last
four or five years.</p>

<p><i>Perennial</i> herbaceous plants are so numerous,
that few general directions can be
given for their culture, and it will be necessary
to treat of the principal families separately.
Perennial flowers are generally propagated
by layers, cuttings, offsets, suckers,
and division of the root; for when raised
from seed, many of the kinds do not blossom
for several years. When propagated by
layers, the earth which is pressed over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
pegged-down shoot, should not be kept too
moist; as layers of herbaceous plants, particularly
where the stem has been partly slit
through, are very apt to rot. The same
remark holds good as to cuttings; and they
should generally have fewer leaves left on,
than cuttings of trees and shrubs. Many
plants produce offsets, such as the potentilla,
the wild geranium, &amp;c., and these only require
separating from the parent, and planting
in spring; all the flower-buds should,
however, be pinched off the first year, to
strengthen the plant, and to encourage it to
send down roots. Suckers are treated in
exactly the same manner as offsets. Division
of the roots is, however, the most common
way of propagating perennials. To do this
the plant is generally taken up, and the roots
pulled asunder if dry, or cut into pieces if
fleshy, and replanted; care being taken to
cut off any part of the fibrous roots that may
have been wounded, or broken, by the removal.
The plant itself is also generally
pruned or cut in, and some of its leaves are
taken off before replanting, and carefully
shaded and watered till it has recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
from the effects of its removal. All perennial
plants should be occasionally taken up,
thinned, and replanted with the same precautions:
and the ground dug over, and
renovated, before they are replaced.</p>

<p>The most remarkable kinds of herbaceous
plants are those called florists’ flowers. This
name indicates plants grown principally for
the purpose of exhibiting at some show to
gain a prize, and on the culture of which
an extraordinary degree of care has been
bestowed. Most of these are either bulbs or
tubers, but some few come under the present
head; and of these the most remarkable are
the auricula, the polyanthus, the carnation,
the pink, the heartsease, and the chrysanthemum.</p>

<p><i>Auriculas</i> are well-known and favourite
flowers; the wild plant is a native of Switzerland,
but it is almost as different from the
cultivated kinds, as the wild cabbage is from
brocoli or cauliflower. The garden auriculas
have almost innumerable names, but they
are all divided into four kinds, very distinct
from each other. These kinds are the green-edged,
the grey-edged, the white-edged, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
the selfs. The beauty of the flowers depends
upon their size, the clearness of their colours,
and their roundness and flatness; these last
qualities being often assisted by art: the
anthers of the stamens should also rise above
the pistil; as when the pistil is seen above
the anthers, the flower is called pin-eyed,
and is esteemed of little value by florists.
The culture of the auricula, when it is to be
grown as a prize-flower, demands a degree
of care and attention that no one but a professed
florist would think it worth his while
to bestow. The great points appear to be
to make the soil as rich as possible, only,
however, using the cold manures, such as
cow-dung, &amp;c.; to let the pots be very well
drained, by placing about an inch and a half
deep of broken pot-shreds in each pot; and
to keep the plants well and regularly watered.
When the flowers expand, they are generally
shaded with square pieces of board,
tin, or paste-board, supported by a stick just
over the flower, so as to shelter it from the
direct influence of the sun, but to admit a
free current of air, and sufficient light. This
precaution is said to improve the clearness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
and intensity of the colours, which otherwise
are apt to become dull and clouded. Those
persons who grow auriculas for sale, generally
show them on what is called a blooming-stage,
and shade them with an awning like that
used for a tulip-bed. The plants are propagated
by offsets, or dividing the root; and
new varieties are continually being raised
from seed. Auriculas are occasionally double
or semi-double, but these varieties are considered
by florists very far inferior to the
single kinds.</p>

<p><i>The Polyanthus</i> is of the same genus as
the auricula, and of the same species as the
primrose. It is, however, a very distinct
variety of the last; and it is said to take its
name of polyanthus, which signifies many-flowered,
from its producing its flowers in
trusses like the auricula, while the flowers of
the primrose are produced singly, each on a
separate stalk rising from the root. The
qualities of the polyanthus resemble those of
the auricula as to form and shape, but there
is not the same variety as to colour, as the
polyanthus is always of a very dark brownish
red and golden yellow. The best flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
have generally a narrow edging of a bright
golden colour, and as clear and distinct as
possible, round the margin of each petal;
and no flower is at all esteemed that has what
is called a pin-eye; that is, as before mentioned
with regard to the auricula, when
the pistil projects beyond the anthers of the
stamens. The polyanthus is propagated by
slips, and division of the root, and new
varieties are raised from seed.</p>

<p><i>The Primrose</i> differs essentially from the
polyanthus and the auricula, in being only
esteemed when double, while they are not
considered to rank as florists’ flowers unless
they are single. The primrose, indeed, is
not a florist’s flower; and its pretty double
pale yellow, dark scarlet, lilac, and white
varieties are only grown as common border
flowers. They like a rich loamy soil, rather
moist than otherwise, and a shady situation;
and they are propagated by division of the
roots.</p>

<p><i>The Carnation</i> has long been a favourite
florists’ flower; and, as it is not quite so
difficult to grow to a considerable degree of
perfection as the auricula, it is also a favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
border flower. The florists’ carnations
are of three kinds, viz.—the flakes,
which are striped with broad bands of two
colours; the bizarres, which are striped or
streaked with three colours; and the picottees,
which are much the hardiest, and are
only bordered with a narrow margin of some
dark colour, or dotted with very small and
almost imperceptible spots. The carnation,
in its wild state, is a native of England, and
is generally found on the walls of some old
castle, or other ruin, or growing in very
poor, gravelly, or calcareous soil. The cultivated
plant, of course, requires different
treatment; and the following directions have
been kindly given to us by one of the first
growers of carnations in France, M. Triquet
de Blanc, Rue de la Madelaine, Paris:—“The
compost should be a fresh mellow
loam, mixed with an equal quantity of what
the French call <i>terre de taupinière</i>, and we,
casts from mole-hills; to this mixture should
be added a fifth of well-rotten cow-dung,
so thoroughly decayed as to have become
quite black. The soil thus prepared should
be pressed firmly into the pots, more so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
indeed, than for any other plant: thus there
should be twice as much earth as usual in
pots for carnations. The pots are placed in
the sun till the 15th or 20th of November,
and watered a little at a time, but often.
After the 20th of November, at latest, the
plants should be kept entirely in the shade,
so that they may not be exposed to the
sun at any time during the day; and it is
also absolutely necessary that they should
be kept under a roof where they may be
sheltered from the rain and snow; but they
must not be put in a hot-house, as a cold
situation suits them much better. During
frosty weather, they should be very little
watered, in order that the soil in which they
grow may not freeze very hard. They are
thus left in the shade till the end of April,
when, there being no longer white hoar
frosts to fear, they may be exposed to the
east, so that the sun may shine upon them
from its rising to the middle of the day,
but no longer. Thus treated, they will grow
luxuriantly, and produce a magnificent show
of flowers.”</p>

<p>The best places for carnations in London,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
are, Groom’s, Walworth; and Hogg’s, Paddington
Green.</p>

<p>Carnations are propagated by layers and
cuttings which, as we have before mentioned,
are called pipings. The layers are made
when the flowers are in full blossom, and
several are made at once, as the operation
frequently kills the old plant, and consequently
cannot be practised with advantage
unless a great many plants are ready to take
its place. The layers are cut half through
as usual; and covered half an inch deep with
mould. As the stalks are very brittle, when
they are wet and succulent, it is customary
to place the plant in the sun for about half
an hour, or an hour, to render it flaccid
before the layers are made. The layers will
generally be well rooted in a month or six
weeks, and will then be ready to be separated
from the parent plant. The mode of treating
pipings has been already described. When
the buds begin to form they are frequently
tied round with a strand of bast mat, to
prevent them from bursting; and just as
they are opening, a bit of paste-board
curiously cut is slipped under the flower to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
keep the petals in their proper place. Each
flower is also furnished with a paper or tin
cap to shade it from the sun, and a stake to
tie it to, in order to keep the stalk erect.
Clove-carnations bear the same relation to
florists’ carnations, as unbroken tulips, or
self-coloured auriculas do to the finer flowers.
The tree-carnation is a half-shrubby variety
of the same species, and the mule pink is a
hybrid between the carnation (Dianthus
caryophyllus) and the sweet-william (Dianthus
barbatus.) All these may be treated
as common perennial border flowers.</p>

<p><i>The Pink.</i>—It is remarkable that though
the pink is a commoner and hardier flower
than the carnation, it is not known in a wild
state, and it does not appear to have been
much cultivated till the latter half of the
last century, though it is said to have been
introduced in 1629. Its origin is indeed
very uncertain; some botanists considering it
as a variety of the carnation, and others
making it a distinct species, under the name
of Dianthus plumarius. There are now
many named sorts, and the best laced pinks
rank as florists’ flowers; their culture being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the same as that of the carnation. The
other kinds are considered inferior, and are
grown like common herbaceous plants in the
open borders.</p>

<p><i>The Heartsease</i> has only within the last few
years ranked as a florist’s flower. It had
long been a favourite in gardens as its innumerable
popular names may testify; but it
was reserved for a young lady, aided by an
industrious and intelligent gardener, to show
the world the extraordinary variations of
which the flower is susceptible. About the
year 1810 or 1812, the present lady Monck,
then Lady Mary Bennet, had a small flower-garden
entirely planted with heartseases in
the garden of her father, the late Earl of
Tankerville, at Walton-upon-Thames. The
young lady naturally wished to get as many
different sorts into her garden as possible;
and at her desire, the gardener, Mr. Richardson,
raised as many new kinds as he could
from seed. From this small beginning the
present passion for heartseases took its rise.
Mr. Richardson, astonished at the great variety
and beauty of his seedlings, showed them to
Mr. Lee, of the Hammersmith Nursery.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Mr. Lee instantly saw the advantages to be
derived from the culture of the plant; other
nurserymen followed his example, and in a
few years the heartsease took its place as a
florists’ flower. The heartsease mania was at
its height from 1835 to 1838; but during the
last year, it has appeared somewhat on the
decline. The most splendid flowers grown
for exhibition are generally hybrids, which
possess, in a great degree, the qualities of
both parents. Thus, though almost every
heartsease has sprung partly from the wild
kind, (Viola tricolor,) its other parent may be
traced by its general appearance. The very
large dark purple and yellow flowers are
descended from Viola grandiflora, a species
with large yellowish flowers; other large
flowers, with dark purple upper petals, and
the lower ones of a bluish tinge, are descended
from V. amœna; and the offspring
of V. lutea are nearly all yellow, strongly
marked with very dark branched lines. The
hybrids raised partly from V. altaica are of
a very pale yellow, and the petals have an
undulated margin; those from V. Rothomogensis,
or V. hispida, are of a pale blue;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
and those from V. bicolor are white, slightly
veined with purple, and tinged with yellow
at the base. All these vary exceedingly by
continual crossings, but some of the characteristics
of the parents always remain.</p>

<p>The culture of the heartsease requires much
attention. It is the habit of the plant to
ripen a succession of seed during the whole
of its flowering season: thus it bears flowers
and ripe seeds at the same time during the
whole summer. The seeds should be sown
in a bed of rich garden mould, at least
eighteen inches deep, and highly manured,
and the young plants should be suffered to
remain till they have flowered, when all the
plants should be taken up, the best replanted
eighteen inches apart if in a bed, or in pots
or boxes, and the inferior ones thrown away.
The best soil for replanting the heartsease,
particularly if they are in pots or boxes, is
rich loam, mixed with one-sixth of sand and
one-sixth of vegetable mould; and in large
towns, all these soils may be purchased in
small quantities from the nurserymen. The
pots and boxes should also be well drained;
for it must be remembered, that though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
heartsease is very liable to be scorched by
the excessive heat of the sun, and will require
constant watering in hot weather; it is also
very liable to be damped off by cold and wet
in winter. The best varieties are propagated
by cuttings, taken off in spring, which
grow rapidly so as to flower the same summer
or autumn. These cuttings should be
taken from the points of the shoots, cutting
them off immediately below a joint; and
they should be struck in pure white sand, as
when the cutting is put into earth it is very
apt to damp off. The cuttings when made
should not be watered, but should be covered
with a bell glass, and shaded for several days,
on account of the succulent nature of the
stems, and great evaporation from the leaves.
Heartseases are sometimes propagated by
layers, in which case the branch should be
only pegged down at a joint, and not slit, on
account of its tendency to damp off.</p>

<p><i>Chrysanthemums</i> are principally winter
flowers, and they are valuable for affording
a brilliant show at a season when there are
few other flowers to be seen. In November
and December, when no other flowers are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
blossom, these flowers are in full beauty;
and Mr. Loudon tells me that he has seen
the walls of two small street-gardens, one
belonging to Mr. Ingpen at Chelsea, and
the other to Mr. Allen, Chapel Street, Edgware-Road,
so completely covered with them
as to present a most brilliant and dazzling
appearance. Chrysanthemums may therefore
be safely recommended as most valuable
flowers for both town and country; and
their great number and beauty make them
particularly interesting. There are, indeed,
numerous varieties of every possible shade
of yellow, brown, orange, buff, pink, reddish-purple,
lilac, and white, but not blue.
All the different varieties of chrysanthemums,
and there are nearly a hundred named sorts,
may be referred to six distinct tribes; and
these are the following: 1. Ranunculus-flowered;
2. Incurved; 3. China-aster, or
Daisy-flowered; 4. Marigold-flowered; 5.
Tassel-flowered, or Quilled; and 6. Half-double
Tassel-flowered. The ranunculus-flowered
have generally small flowers, in
clusters, like little roses; but the rest have
large, handsome flowers, particularly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
tasselled kinds, the quilled petals of which
are very long, and hang down like tassels.
The culture of the chrysanthemum differs
according to the use which it is proposed to
make of it. When it is to be flowered in
pots, cuttings are taken from the tops of the
shoots in April; and as soon as they have
taken root they are transplanted into very
small pots, where they are planted in a compost
formed of equal parts of sand, loam, and
peat. As soon as they begin to grow, and
send out plenty of roots, they are removed
into other, rather larger, pots; and this
shifting is repeated eight or nine, and sometimes
ten or twelve times. This constant
shifting will keep the plants bushy, without
the cultivator being under the necessity of
pinching off the ends of the shoots; a practice
which, though it answers the desired
end of keeping the plants of a compact habit
of growth, has yet the inconvenience of
making them throw out so many shoots and
leaves as to weaken the flowers. When the
chrysanthemums are to be planted in the
open border against a wall, their roots
should be parted in autumn or early spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and planted in very rich and highly manured,
but light soil, at the foot of a south or
west wall, against which they should be
trained like a peach-tree, and all the superfluous
shoots cut off. When planted, they
should be carefully watered, not only at their
roots, but all over their leaves, with a fine-rosed
watering-pot, or garden-engine. They
should afterwards be watered three times a-day,
and occasionally with soap-suds, or manured
water, that is, water in which manure
has been steeped. Thus treated, the plants
will grow six or eight feet high, and their
flowers will not only be produced in great
abundance, but they will be of enormous
size, and very brilliant in their colours. The
best chrysanthemums in London are at
Chandler’s nursery, Vauxhall.</p>

<p><i>Bulbs and Tubers.</i>—The most interesting
bulbs in a flower-garden are the tulip, the
hyacinth, and the crocus; and the most
interesting tubers are the ranunculus, the
anemone, and the dahlia. There are, however,
many other flowers of both kinds
highly deserving of cultivation. The culture
of all the bulbs is nearly the same; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
that of the tuberous-rooted flowers differs in
different plants.</p>

<p><i>Bulbs</i> are generally planted in autumn to
flower in spring; and are taken up when
their leaves begin to wither, to be kept out
of the ground a month or two in complete
repose before they are replanted. They are
generally propagated by offsets, which are
produced by the side of the old bulb; or
rather, by the side of the new bulb, which is
formed every year to supply the place of the
old one, which wastes away. The new bulb
sometimes forms beside the old one; and
sometimes below it or above it; and this is
one of the principal reasons why bulbs should
be taken up and replanted every year; as,
when this is not attended to, those bulbs that
form every year below the old bulb, sink so
low in the course of a few years, that they
become too far removed from the air to vegetate;
while those that form above the old
bulb are pushed so high out of the ground
that they are often killed by frost or drought.
In this way, valuable plants often disappear
from gardens, without their owners having
the slightest suspicion of the cause. It is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
however, rarely worth while to take up the
common garden bulbs: such as the snow-drop,
the crown-imperial, &amp;c., every year;
particularly as they generally form their new
bulbs at the side of the old bulb: but even
these kinds should be taken up every two or
three years. When raised from seed, bulbs
are generally from three to five years before
they produce flowers; and they are never
propagated by layers or cuttings.</p>

<p><i>Tulips.</i>—Experienced florists raise tulips
from seed to obtain new varieties; but as
the young bulbs are frequently from five
to seven years before they flower, this mode
of propagating tulips does not suit amateurs.
Even when seedling tulips do flower, they produce
only self-coloured flowers, for the first
two or three years, and in this state they are
called breeders. To make them break, that
is, produce the brilliant and distinct colours
which constitute the beauty of a florist’s
tulip, they are subjected to the most sudden
and violent changes of soil, climate, and
management. At one time, they are grown
in poor soil, and only allowed enough water
to keep them living; and then they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
suddenly transported to the richest soil,
abounding with food and moisture. Sometimes,
to change the climate effectually,
florists send their tulips to be grown for a
year or two twenty miles or more from the
place where they were raised; and then
they are brought back to their native air.
This laborious and unscientific mode of proceeding
is, however, now rapidly giving
place to a proper method of hybridizing;
after which the young bulbs are brought
forward by means of bottom-heat, water,
and frequent shiftings, so as to flower and
break the second or third season. Florists’
tulips are generally divided into four tribes,
viz.—1. Bizarres, which have yellow grounds
shaded with dark red or purple, and which
are sub-divided into flamed, in which the
red or purple is in a broad stripe or band,
rising from the bottom of the petal,—and
feathered, in which the dark colour forms a
marginal edging to the petals, descending
into them in various little delicate feathery
veins. 2. Byblœmens, having white grounds
shaded with violet or dark purple, and also
sub-divided into flamed and feathered. 3.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
Roses, having white grounds shaded with
rose-colour or cherry-red, and divided into
flamed and feathered; and, 4. Selfs, being
either a pure white or yellow. In addition
to these, the French have Baguettes, very
tall-stemmed tulips, the flowers of which
are white, striped with dark brownish red;
Baguettes Rigauts, which resemble the former,
but have shorter stems and longer
flowers; and Flamands, which are the same
as Byblœmens. The Dutch have also a
kind they call Incomparable Verport, a very
finely-shaped flower, white, and feathered
with bright shining brown. All these kinds
are said to be varieties of one species, Tulipa
Gesneriana, a native of Italy; and they all
ought to have round, cup-shaped flowers,
clean at the base, and with all the marks
and different colours quite clear and distinct.
Besides these florists’ tulips, several other
species are occasionally grown in gardens:
the most common of which are the little Van
Thol tulips, which were named after the
Duke Van Thol, and which are scarlet,
edged with yellow; the wild French tulip,
which is a pure yellow, and very fragrant;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and the Parrot tulip, which appears to be a
variety of the last, and the petals of which
are yellow, irregularly striped or spotted
with green, scarlet, and blue, and fringed at
the margin.</p>

<p>The culture of the tulip, as a florist’s
flower, requires unremitting attention and
care; but for common garden purposes, the
tulip will be found hardier, and less liable to
injury from insects, &amp;c., than most other
flowers. Where tulips are grown in a regular
bed, the ground should be dug out to the
depth of twenty inches, or two feet. A
stratum of fresh earth is laid at the bottom
of the pit thus formed, on that a stratum of
rotten cow-dung, and on this a stratum of
loam mixed with sand. The bed should be
three or four feet wide, and its surface
should be slightly raised in the middle. A
fresh bed should be made every year, or
rather the same bed should be filled with
fresh soil every season; as the exudations
from the tulips will soon poison the ground
for plants of the same kind, though it will be
very suitable for the growth of other bulbs,
and tubers. The proper distance at which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
the tulips should be planted in the bed is
seven inches apart, every way; and their
colours and kinds may be arranged according
to the fancy of the planter. It is customary,
where the tulips differ a good deal in height,
to place the tallest in the middle, and the
lower ones on the sides; and when this is
the case, the centre of the surface of the bed
need not be raised. The bed is protected
by hoops and mats, which are contrived to
open to admit light, air, and rain at pleasure.
When the plants are near flowering, a path
is made round the bed; and over the whole
is stretched a canvass covering, supported
on a wooden frame, and so contrived as to
open at the sides or the top, as may be
required. The bulbs are planted about two
or three inches deep, and are never watered,
except occasionally by admitting a gentle
rain, till they are in flower. When they
have done flowering, the leaves are suffered
to remain till they begin to turn brown,
when the bulbs are taken up, and laid with
the lower part upwards on shelves to dry.
When this is the case, the dry leaves and
the fibrous roots are pulled or rubbed off;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
and the bulbs are put into drawers or boxes,
divided into compartments so as to keep the
named sorts apart, till the season arrives for
replanting, which is the last week of October
or the first of November.</p>

<p>Mr. Groom, of Walworth, is the principal
tulip-grower in the neighbourhood of London,
and he has an exhibition of them of
extraordinary brilliancy and beauty every
May.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i> are perhaps the most beautiful
of all flowers, and when grown in a bed like
tulips, they are almost equally brilliant in
effect. Mr. Corsten, a Dutch florist, residing
at a place he has called Hyacinth Villa, at
Shepherd’s Bush, has an exhibition of this kind
every April, and I have seldom seen any thing
more striking. Under a tent nearly two
hundred feet long, and thirty feet wide, are
two beds each about one hundred and fifty
feet long, divided by a walk covered with
matting in the centre, and surrounded by a
similar walk, with seats at each end of the
tent. In these beds are above three thousand
hyacinths, the colours arranged so as to
form diagonal lines, and the whole presenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
a perfect blaze of beauty. Hyacinths are as
numerous in their named varieties as tulips,
but they are not divided into any distinct
tribes, except as regards their colours. The
principal distinctions are the white, the pink,
and the blue; but these admit of various
modifications, and there are some of a pale
yellow, or rather lemon colour, and some of
so dark a purple as to be almost black.</p>

<p>The culture of the hyacinth somewhat
resembles that of the tulip; but it is more
difficult, from the great length to which the
roots of the hyacinth descend perpendicularly,
and the necessity which consequently
exists for preparing the ground for them to a
very great depth. There is also another
peculiarity in hyacinth culture which is
rather difficult of attainment; namely, that
the roots require a great deal of moisture,
though the bulbs should be kept quite dry.
The roots also require the soil to be very
rich, but that the manure used should be of
the kind called cold. It will easily be seen
from this enumeration of the essentials for
hyacinth culture, why Holland is so pre-eminently
the country for hyacinths. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
dry sandy soil, raised on the numerous dykes
and embankments, by means of which Holland
has been rescued from the sea, affords
at once a proper bed for the bulbs, and a
soil easily penetrable by the roots; while
the constant evaporation rising from the
water which is every where found below the
dykes, is just what is required for the roots.
Even the manure most easily obtained in
Holland is precisely that best adapted for
hyacinths, as it is cow-dung unmixed with
straw; and which thus contains nothing to
induce fermentation and consequent heat.</p>

<p>It is impossible in England to obtain the
advantages so easily attainable by the Dutch,
without incurring a very considerable expence.
Our soil is generally so adhesive
that it requires to be pulverized to a very
great depth to admit of the descent of the
roots; and even when the soil is sandy it is
very different from the beautiful silvery sea-sand,
called Dünensande by the Dutch. The
only way in which we can imitate this sand
is by mixing nearly in equal parts what we
call silver-sand and peat, or by growing the
plants in silver-sand, with a very slight admixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
of fine vegetable mould. Whatever
the soil may be, it can hardly be too light,
as the Dutch say that the hyacinth will
never thrive unless in sand so fine as to be
blown away in separate particles by a high
wind. When hyacinths are to be grown to
the greatest perfection in England, a bed, or
rather pit, should be dug three feet or four
feet wide, and six feet deep, the length
depending on the situation, and on the
quantity of flowers to be grown. A layer of
stale cow-dung, without any mixture of
straw or litter, should be laid at the bottom
of this pit at least a foot deep, and the pit
should then be filled up to within three
inches of the top, with equal parts of peat
and silver-sand, or with a mixture of three
parts of silver-sand to one of light vegetable
mould perfectly fine and without any stones.
About three inches from the top should be
spread a layer of pure sand in which the
bulbs are placed at regular distances, and
each with the pointed end, which the Dutch
call the nose, upwards; and the bed is then
filled up with the same mixture as the lower
part, and a layer about three inches deep of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
pure peat is laid over the whole, to form a
relief to the flowers. Dry weather should
always be chosen for the planting; and
when planted, the bulbs should be entirely
covered with the sand, and should be about
six inches below the surface of the bed,
which should be raised at least three inches
higher than the surrounding garden, to allow
for its sinking. The layer of pure peat on
the surface is only to afford a dark background
to the flowers when they expand,
and may be omitted if thought unnecessary
for this purpose. The bulbs are planted the
last week in October, or the first or second
week in November, and they are placed
about four inches apart every way. After
they are planted, a mixture of cow-dung and
water is generally thrown with a scoop over
the bed, so as to form a thin coating over
the soil, but not to penetrate into it. When
the weather becomes frosty, a covering of
dry litter, reeds, or tan is put over the beds;
or hoops may be fixed over them on which
bast mats are stretched. In March the
covering is removed and the beds are cleared
of weeds, and covered with a fresh coating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
of cow-dung and water. In April, an awning
of thin canvass, is erected over each bed,
under which the plants are to flower; and
by the middle of this month they will be in
all their beauty. As soon as the flowers
begin to fade the flower-stalks should be cut
off and instantly removed. They should
never be suffered to lie on the bed, and
should not even be put where by any chance
they can mix with the earth intended for a
hyacinth bed in another year, as the exudations
proceeding from them in their decay
would cause the bulbs to rot. This is not
only because the exudations from the hyacinths
are of course poisonous to other bulbs
of the same genus; but because the flower-stalks
appear to contain a kind of corrosive
juice, as the labourers employed in Holland
to cut them off the bulbs, frequently find
their hands and bodies become red and inflamed,
and sometimes so painful as to prevent
them from sleeping.</p>

<p>When the leaves turn brown at the points,
which is generally about the middle of June,
the bulbs should be taken up. When this
is to be done the leaves are first pulled off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
or if they will not come off readily by pulling,
they are cut off close to the bulb. The
bulbs are then taken out of the ground, and
laid on the footpath in rows, so as to keep
the different kinds distinct. The bed is
afterwards raked smooth all over, and a strip
about a foot and a half broad is made flat
and firm, in the middle of the bed, by being
pressed with a plank, or beaten with the
back of the spade, and on this the hyacinth-roots
are laid, still in distinct rows: earth is
then drawn over them two or three inches
thick, and they are left for two or three weeks.
This the Dutch call lying in the Käuil, and
the time of remaining in it varies according
to the size of the bulb and the weather, the
largest bulbs being removed soonest. When
taken from the Käuil, the bulbs are placed
on shelves or wooden trays to dry, with the
root end of the bulb inclining towards the
south.</p>

<p>Where it is not thought advisable to sink
the bed so deep as six feet, it may be made
four feet deep, and the layer of cow-dung at
the bottom mixed with soil a foot deep,
leaving only about three feet to be filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
a mixture of peat and river sand, with about
the proportion of a third to the whole of
vegetable mould. The other treatment is
the same as that detailed above. In all
cases the soil should be very light and fine,
and only cow-dung should be used as a
manure. The roots should also always be
watered very sparingly, and with a mixture
of cow dung and water, though not so thick
as that used for coating the bed. When the
bulbs are planted, and again when they are
taken up, they should be carefully examined,
and all that are at all specked or mouldy,
should be laid on one side, as they would
infect the others. When the infected part
is large, the bulb should be thrown away, or
burnt with the stalks; but where the speck
is small it should be cut out with a sharp
knife, and the bulb planted, in not more
than four-and-twenty hours after the piece
has been cut out. Hyacinths are propagated
by offsets, by dividing the bulb, and by
seed, in which last case they are five years
before they flower. When planted in pots
or boxes, the pot or box should be half filled
with broken potsherds, or some other material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
to ensure perfect drainage, and the bulbs
should be planted in a compost of peat, sand,
and very rotten cow-dung. The bulbs should
only be about half covered with soil; and if
in boxes they should be kept, if practicable,
in a greenhouse, till they are ready to flower.
If in pots, they should be plunged into a hotbed,
or into a tan-stove; or where this cannot
be done they should be buried in the garden,
so that the point of the bulb should be at
least four inches below the surface. Here
they should remain till about six weeks before
flowering, when the pots should be taken
out, and placed where they are to flower;
the sides of the pots being kept warm with
moss, and the flowers brought forward by
daily waterings. All hyacinths grown in
pots and boxes will require abundance of
water to make amends for the unnatural
situation in which their roots are placed.
After hyacinths have flowered in pots or
boxes, or in water glasses, the bulbs are
generally planted in the open ground, and
being covered with about an inch of soil
they are left to take their chance. Thus
treated, the finer kinds generally perish, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
the hardier ones will live and flower for
many years, if allowed every autumn to
retain their leaves, till their new bulbs are
matured. Hyacinths that have been flowered
in glasses, or pots, seldom however flower
so well afterwards, at least not for several
years, as they scarcely ever quite recover the
shock they have sustained from the unnatural
position of their roots; whereas the
Dutch florists, by allowing the roots of their
hyacinths plenty of room to descend perpendicularly,
and taking up the bulbs every
autumn, have been known to keep bulbs of
their finest flowers twelve or even twenty
years, and to have them produce splendid
flowers every year.</p>

<p>It must be observed that the exudations of
hyacinths are very abundant, and very injurious
to other plants of their own genus.
For this reason, the Dutch never grow their
hyacinths in the same bed two years consecutively.
The usual rotation is, first year,
hyacinths; second, tulips; third, polyanthus-narcissus;
fourth, crocuses; and fifth, hyacinths
again. The Guernsey lily, the bulbs
of which are generally thrown away in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
as soon as they have flowered, will live
many years if treated like the hyacinth.</p>

<p><i>Crocuses</i> may be grown in the open ground,
and they do not require taking up every year
like hyacinths or tulips. If they are taken
up and replanted every third or fourth year,
it will be sufficient. There are above a hundred
named varieties, and they will produce
a very good effect if planted so as to form
figures with their various colours. When
this is the case, however, the corms should be
taken up and replanted every year; to prevent
the figure from becoming confused by
the spreading of the offsets. Crocuses may
be grown in glasses, or in pots or boxes, with
very little injury, if planted in the open
ground as soon as they have done flowering,
and suffered to mature their leaves. In all
cases the leaves of the crocus should be suffered
to remain till they wither, and not cut
off; though many gardeners, from a mistaken
desire for neatness, cut the leaves off as soon
as the flowers have faded, and thus seriously
injure the corms. All the kinds of gladiolus
or corn flag, the Irises, the Ixias, and, in short
all the Cape bulbs, are corms, and require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
the same treatment as the crocus. Charlwood’s,
Covent-garden, and Carter’s, Holborn,
are the best places in London for procuring
all kinds of bulbs and corms.</p>

<p><i>The Ranunculus.</i>—M. Triquet de Blanc,
who had the kindness to send me directions
for the culture of the carnation, has given
me the following directions for the culture
of the ranunculus:—“In November spread
well-rotten cow-dung, or thoroughly-decayed
leaves, four or five inches thick over the
beds which are to be devoted to the ranunculus,
and dig it into the ground about four
inches deep, digging the bed over several
times, so as to mix it well with the soil.
The surface of the bed is then raked smooth,
and lines, or rather drills, an inch and a half
deep, are traced on it so as to form squares,
four inches on the side every way. The
ground is then left till the beginning of
February, when the ranunculuses are planted
four inches apart, just at the point of intersection
of the lines, and they are covered
about an inch and a half deep (rather less
than more) with the compost described
above, or with fine garden mould. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
advantages gained by digging the earth in
November, though the roots are not planted
till February, are—that the ranunculuses
are thus planted on a hard bottom, which
suits them particularly; and that the gardener
is not obliged to dig the earth to
mix the cow-dung with it in February, when
the ground is generally sloppy, and in a
very unfit state for being worked.”—When
the plants are about to flower, an awning
may be erected over the bed to protect them
from the effects of the sun, which is apt to
destroy the brilliancy of their colours. In
frosty weather, they should be protected by
a mat, day and night, as the sun will do
them a serious injury, if they have been at
all affected by the frost. The plants may be
watered with a weak solution of cow-dung
in water, and they should be constantly
watered in dry weather. The tubers should
be taken up as soon as the leaves begin to
turn brown, which will generally be in July.
Groom, of Walworth, is considered to keep
the best ranunculuses.</p>

<p><i>The Anemones</i> of florists are of two kinds:
those descended from the garden or star
anemone (A. hortense), and those descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
from the poppy anemone (A. coronaria).
The poppy anemones, which are generally
single, are planted in September or October,
and under shelter are frequently in flower
all winter: the splendid Dutch anemones,
and all the varieties of A. coronaria, on the
contrary, are not planted till February or
March; the latter month, or even the beginning
of April, being preferred for the Dutch
anemones, which are apt to rot if planted too
early. Anemones should be planted three
inches deep, and five inches apart every
way, in a fresh, sound, yellow loam, without
any manure. Care should be taken to keep
the frost from them; but they will not need
any other attention till the leaves turn
brown, when the tubers should be taken up,
and treated like those of the ranunculus and
tulip. Old varieties are propagated by offsets,
and new kinds are raised from seed.</p>

<p><i>Dahlias</i> are either raised from seed, or
propagated by slips or cuttings, or dividing
the tubers. The seed is sown in pots in
a slight hotbed in February, and the young
plants are transplanted into the open air
in June, where they are suffered to remain
till they flower. In October, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
which are thought worth preserving are
marked, and the others taken up and thrown
away. When the stalks are killed by frost,
the tubers are taken up, and kept in some
dry place till the season of planting the following
year. The slips are taken from the
collar of the root in spring, and the cuttings
from the tops of the young shoots early in
summer. Both are planted in very small
pots, in light, rich, sandy loam, and placed
in a hotbed frame, and shaded. In a fortnight
they will have struck root; but they
should be shifted into larger pots, and placed
for a short time in a greenhouse, before they
are turned out into the open ground. Dahlias
have large tuberous roots, but stems will
only spring from the eyes or buds in the
crown of the root. If these eyes should have
been destroyed, or be wanting, the root is
said to be blind; and though it will live for
several years in the ground, it will not send
up a single stem. For this reason, before
dividing the root, it should be planted in a
gentle hotbed to develope or start the buds
or eyes; and when it is divided, care should
be taken that each piece includes a portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
of the crown, which has an eye in it. Sometimes
eyes are grafted in the herbaceous
manner on blind tubers.</p>

<p>The best soil for dahlias is a sandy loam,
not too rich, as, in rich or moist soils, the
plant will produce more stalks and leaves
than flowers. Where the soil of the garden
in which dahlias are to be planted is
rich, or heavy, a quantity of sand or gravel
should be mixed with it. Striped or variegated
flowers will soon lose their markings if
grown in rich soil. The tubers of the early
kinds are planted in April, to flower in
June; but those of the finer kinds are not
planted till May and June. When they
begin to grow, the side-shoots are removed
from one foot to three feet from the ground;
the principal stem is then either tied to a
stake driven deeply and firmly into the
ground, or the whole plant is drawn through
a set of dahlia rings. Dwarf plants are
frequently suffered to trail on the ground,
and are pegged down, so as to cover the
whole of the bed, with which treatment they
look extremely well. In dry weather, the
plants should be regularly watered, but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
too abundantly. When the leaves and stalks
are killed by the frost, they should be directly
cut down; but the tubers may be left in the
ground a little longer, as, if taken up too
soon, they will shrivel, and often become
rotten. When taken up, they should be
kept in a dry place, and covered with a mat
to exclude the frost.</p>

<p>All the dahlias now in our gardens, numerous
as they are, have sprung from two
kinds, both natives of Mexico, viz.—D. pinnata,
or variabilis, all the varieties of which
are purple, crimson, rose-coloured, lilac, or
white; and D. coccinea, the varieties of
which are scarlet, orange, or yellow.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that notwithstanding the
numerous varieties that have been raised of
these two species, there have never been any
hybrids raised between them. Many attempts
have been made, but all the plants
raised have partaken exclusively of the qualities
of one or the other of the parents, and
none have partaken equally of both, as is the
case with true hybrids. There are many
other kinds mentioned in books, the most
remarkable of which is the tree dahlia, D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
excelsa, a specimen of which, in the Liverpool
Botanic Garden, is now above twenty feet
high. All the varieties grown in British
gardens as florists’ flowers, may be divided
into four kinds, viz.—Dwarfs, Anemone-flowered,
Ranunculus-flowered, and Globe-flowered.
The dahlia was first discovered in
Mexico by Baron Humboldt, in 1789, and
it was sent by him to Cavaniles, at Madrid,
who named it in honour of Professor Dahl,
a Swedish botanist. This name was afterwards
changed to Georgina, in honour of
a German botanist named Georgi, who
resided many years in St. Petersburg, in
consequence of the genus Dalea having
been previously established by Thunberg.
As, however, this name is neither spelt nor
pronounced the same as Dahlia; and as the
name of Dahlia was given long before that
of Georgina, the plant is now restored to its
original appellation. The dahlia was introduced
into England in 1804, but it did not
become a florists’ flower till about 1815.</p>

<p class="c less sp">MANAGEMENT OF THE LAWN, PLEASURE-GROUNDS,<br>
AND SHRUBBERY, OF A SMALL
VILLA.</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> word Lawn may probably conjure up
ideas of too large an extent of ground to be
managed by a lady; but when I use the
term, I do not mean an extensive park-like
surface of level turf, but one of those beautiful
verdant glades that produce so delightful
an effect even in the smallest gardens. In
places where the whole extent of garden-ground
does not perhaps exceed an acre,
every one must have felt the relief afforded
to the eye by a broad strip of lawn, bordered
by trees and shrubs, not in a formal line on
each side, but running into numerous projections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
and recesses, and resting their lower
branches, frequently covered with flowers,
on a rich smooth velvet-looking carpet of
grass.</p>

<p>Every one possessing a lawn of this description
must be aware that its chief beauty
consists in its smoothness, and in the firmness
and closeness of its grasses. I say
grasses, because strange as it may sound to
unbotanical ears, from twenty to thirty different
kinds of grasses sometimes enter into
the composition of a square foot of fine turf.
Some of these grasses are coarse and grow
high, and widely apart; and others are very
fine and slender, and grow closely together.
This being the case, it is obvious that when
a fine smooth turf is required, the finer kinds
of grasses should be chosen, and the coarser
ones not only rejected among the grass-seeds
sown, but, if possible, destroyed whenever
they appear, if they should chance to
come up accidentally.</p>

<p>Botanists have distinguished and arranged
nearly fifteen hundred different species of
grasses; and of these probably more than
three hundred kinds are now cultivated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
England. Of these, some are, of course,
better adapted to certain soils than others;
and to ascertain which grass was best suited
to each soil, the late Duke of Bedford, whose
loss the horticultural and agricultural world
has recently had to deplore, instituted a
series of experiments at Woburn under the
superintendence of his gardener, the late
Mr. Sinclair, who was a very intelligent
man, and the result of which was published
in the Hortus Gramineus Woburnensis.
From these experiments, it was found that
what are called hungry sandy soils, were the
worst, and rich alluvial soils the best for the
production of grasses; but that sandy loams
produced the most equal and most permanent
crops. To apply this to practice in the
production of proper lawn grasses, it is evident
that as a sandy loam appears to be the
best for them, a sandy soil would be improved
by the addition of clay, and a clayey one by
the addition of sand, both these mixtures
constituting what is called a sandy loam: and
it may be added, that where the soil is calcareous,
it may generally be left without any
alteration, when it is to be covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
grass. The next thing to be considered is
the kind of grasses most suitable for sowing
on a lawn; and to ascertain this, it must be
remembered that the proprietor of a lawn
does not want a crop of hay, but a fine
smooth level turf, the grass in which shall
entirely conceal the earth. For this purpose,
it is evident that slow growing grasses,
the roots of which will retain permanent
possession of the soil, and which are sufficiently
succulent not to be burnt up when
closely mown in hot weather, are preferable
to those which grow rapidly and produce an
abundant crop of herbage, particularly as the
roots of the last kind are generally easily
withered up in dry weather. Very fast-growing
grasses are indeed exceedingly annoying
to the possessor of a small lawn, as
they require constant mowing and are thus
a constant source of expence.</p>

<p>Some philosophers assert that the chief
thing that hinders the attainment of our
desires, is that very few of us know exactly
what we want; and it is to save my readers
from being in this unpleasant predicament
with regard to lawns, that I have been thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
particular in describing what qualities are
requisite in grasses to make them suitable
for producing soft turf. The next thing is
to tell them as well as I can, what kind of
grasses appear most likely to answer the end
in view. Of all these, one of the most permanent
appears to be the fox-tail meadow-grass
(Alopecurus pratensis); it is one of the
principal grasses in rich natural pastures,
and it should always form one-fourth part of
the seeds used for laying down a lawn. The
sweet-scented spring grass (Anthoxanthum
odoratum) grows best in deep moist soil; but
it is worth sowing in every situation for its
fineness, its dwarf growth, and for its habit
of continuing to vegetate, and to throw up
fresh stalks nearly all the year. It is this
grass which gives so delightful a fragrance to
new hay. The common meadow-grass (Poa
pratensis) is also suitable for lawns; as,
though of slow growth, it has creeping permanent
roots: and the short blue meadow-grass
(Poa cærulea) may be added, for its
deep blue tint, which gives a richness to the
general colour of the grass, and because it
sustains no injury from dry weather. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
crested dog’s-tail grass (Cynosurus cristatus)
is, however, the best for sustaining drought
and heat, as its roots penetrate so deeply
into the ground, as to keep its blades green,
while all the grasses around it are quite
brown from being burnt up. The hard
fescue grass (Festuca duriuscula) is another
kind which will stand the effects of dry
weather; it is also a very fine dwarf grass,
and springs early. Many other grasses
might be named, but these will suffice. The
proportion in which they ought to be mixed,
is another, and an essential point; but at the
same time it is one rather difficult to ascertain,
as the seeds of the finer kinds of grasses
are very often abortive, and do not germinate;
and thus a larger quantity must be
sown of them, than of those kinds, all the
seeds of which are generally good. The
seed of the meadow fox-tail grass (Alopecurus
pratensis) is very often so bad, that not
above one seed in three will germinate, consequently
a much larger proportion of seed
of this grass must be sown than of any of the
others. This seed is very light, and consequently
a pound of it, if bought by weight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
will appear a great deal more than a pound
of the crested dog’s-tail grass (Cynosurus
cristatus), the seed of which is very heavy;
and yet as the latter seed is generally all
good, it will cover more ground with grass
than the other. The best way is to write
down the botanic names of the grasses, and
to send them to a respectable seedsman,
with directions to return enough of the seed
of each, to produce an equal quantity of grass
of each respective species on the lawn. The
whole quantity required of the mixed grasses
is generally not more than four bushels
and a half per acre; but if an immediate
effect be wanted, about a bushel and a half
of the common white clover may be added.
This quantity of seed will be sufficient to
sow the ground very thickly, as when ground
has been dug over and rendered perfectly
smooth the seeds will go further, and cover
it more completely than when the surface is
uneven; and if the seeds are sown in dry
weather, then rolled in and afterwards watered,
the ground will be as green and
covered with as fine a sward the first season,
as though it had been laid down with turf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
The plants will, however, probably be too
thick; and as, when this is the case many of
them die, the ground may require a partial
re-sowing the following spring. It is therefore
safer under ordinary circumstances not
to sow more than four bushels and a half an
acre, as if that quantity be equally distributed,
the plants will not be too thick.</p>

<p>When the ground which is to form the
lawn has been marked out, the soil, if it
wants amelioration, should be spread over
with the earth required to make it approach
as near as possible to the great desideratum,
a sandy loam, and it should be then dug
about a foot deep. Care should be taken to
do this in dry weather; as the two soils to be
mixed, should be both in a state of dryness.
No manure should be dug in unless the soil
happen to be very poor indeed; as manure will
tend to produce a larger and taller growing
crop of grass, which, of course, will increase
the trouble and expence of mowing, without
being of any use. The ground being dug,
and raked to remove all the large stones, the
surface should be rolled, and then the seeds
sown; after which it should be rolled again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
and watered by a garden-engine having a
very fine rose. This watering may be repeated
occasionally if the weather should be
very dry; and if any mole-hills or worm-casts
appear, they should be levelled, and the
rolling repeated.</p>

<p>When the ground is to be covered with
turf, instead of being sown with grass seeds,
the turf should, if possible, be procured from
some meadow or downs where sheep have
been fed; as these animals bite close to the
roots, and this kills the coarser grasses which
have generally weak fibrous roots, while the
finer grasses, which have deep roots, remain
uninjured. The turf is then cut with a turf
spade, and rolled up for removal. When it
is to be laid down, and the ground is ready to
receive it, it is spread out, and the different
rolls carefully joined to each other: little bits
being cut off or pushed in where the pieces
do not exactly fit. It is then watered and
rolled, and will require no other care. With
regard to after management, a lawn can
never be kept neat without frequent mowing,
and this is an operation which a lady cannot
very well perform for herself: unless, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
she have strength enough to use one of Budding’s
mowing machines. In whatever way,
however, the operation may be performed, it
should be repeated very frequently. In large
establishments, the lawn is always mown
every week during summer; and even in the
smallest gardens the grass should never be
suffered to remain more than a fortnight
during summer without mowing. The roots
will thus become weakened, and will not be
able to send up any but dwarf and fine blades
of grass, which will form in a few years that
beautifully smooth and soft velvet-like turf,
which it is the principal beauty of a lawn to
possess. “It is a great mistake,” says Mr.
Loudon, in his <i>Suburban Gardener</i>, “to suppose
that anything is gained in the way of
economy by suffering the grass of lawns to
grow long before mowing, in order to save
the expense of once or twice mowing during
the season; for, in proportion as the grass is
allowed to grow long before mowing, in the
same proportion are the roots strengthened
and enabled to send up still longer leaves
and stems; whereas if a lawn were kept
short by frequent mowing for two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
years in succession, the plants of grass would
at last become so weak that not one-half the
mowing usually required for even slovenly-kept
lawns would be necessary, and the turf
would be much finer, and neater in appearance.”
The best manure for a lawn is soot.</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer than I otherwise should
have done on the management of lawns, not
only because I am a great admirer of a smooth
green turf, but because I believe it is a subject
not generally understood. Most persons
imagine that if they lay down turf, or sow
grass seeds, they have done all that is requisite;
and my object is simply to impress
upon the minds of my readers, that this is
not enough: for as there are different kinds
of turf and grasses, it is as necessary to choose
which to take, as to select flowers for the
flower-garden. I have only to add that the
brownish hue sometimes observed on the
brows of hills in pleasure grounds is produced
by holcus lanatus, a kind of couch-grass, that
wastes all its strength on its fleshy roots, and
produces only a thin and wiry herbage.
This species, the different kinds of agrostis
or bent-grass, the brome grasses, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
Bromus arvensis, and the cock’s-foot grass,
Dactylus glomerata, should never be sown in
lawns.</p>

<p>Grass seeds should be sown either in spring
or autumn; and May, and August or September
are considered the best months. In
very old lawns, moss is apt to predominate,
and when it is wished to destroy this, the
surface of the lawn is dressed, as it is called,
in May with lime. Dressing with lime will
also destroy the worms which are often very
troublesome in lawns (particularly where the
ground has been manured with dung), in
throwing up casts, which make the ground
uneven, and very difficult to mow.</p>

<p><i>The Walks in pleasure-grounds</i> should be
hard and dry; and they should also be sufficiently
wide to admit of three persons to
walk abreast occasionally; as nothing can be
more disagreeable than the situation of the
third person, whom the narrowness of the
walk obliges to walk before or behind his
companions; and who is obliged either to
remain silent or to carry on a most uncomfortable
and disjointed kind of conversation.
The minor evils of clothes being caught by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
branches, and leaves discharging on the
pedestrians the remains of a recent shower,
would likewise be avoided by broader walks.</p>

<p><i>The laying out of pleasure grounds</i> embraces
a wide field; and when they are
extensive they require the eye of a painter,
as well as the taste and skill of a landscape
gardener. Even in small places, so much
depends on situation (particularly as regards
the house, and whether there may or may
not be any distant prospects); on the taste of
the occupier; and on the expense to be
incurred, not only in laying out and planting,
but in after keeping, that few directions can
be given that would be generally applicable.
It may, however, be observed that in all
places whether large or small, the walks
should be so contrived, that no person passing
along one, should see the persons walking
on another. Indeed, if more than one walk
be ever seen at a time, it gives an idea of
want of space and confinement; and this idea
is one which the landscape gardener always
endeavours as much as possible to avoid.
For the same reason the boundary fence
should never be seen, if it can possibly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
disguised. Even in a small street-garden,
with three low walls on three of the sides,
and the house on the fourth, a very pleasing
effect may be produced by effectually concealing
the boundary walls with ivy; and
thus permitting the imagination to fix the
boundary where it will.</p>

<p>Another general rule in laying out pleasure-grounds
is to avoid monotony or sameness
as much as possible. Nothing is more
wearying to the eye than a place, every part
of which is alike, and which leaves nothing
to the imagination. A place regularly dotted
over with trees at equal distances is quite
featureless; has nothing to attract the eye, and
nothing to interest the mind. But if the
same trees are planted on the same ground
in masses, with a broad expanse of lawn
between; the trees sometimes projecting,
and sometimes showing a smooth glade of
grass, running in among them, the end of
which the eye cannot reach, the imagination
becomes excited, and a degree of interest is
instantly created. Where the lawn is large,
a few single trees may be introduced; but
few things in landscape gardening require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
more taste. Indeed, in laying out pleasure-grounds,
however small they may be, it is
generally the best, and indeed the most
economical way, to have the advice of a professional
landscape gardener at first; instead
of groping on in the dark, from a mistaken
idea of economy, till at last it is discovered
that all is wrong, and must be done over
again. Thus in the end, the work is generally
found to have cost twice as much as
would have been expended if it had been
begun properly at first; besides the loss of
time, and the annoyance always occasioned
by having anything to undo.</p>

<p><i>The Trees and Shrubs.</i>—In all places sufficiently
small to be managed by a lady,
without the aid of a regular gardener, the
trees and shrubs should be of the choicest
kinds. It is quite the fashion of the present
day to plant arboretums; and though a place
of the kind I mention would not admit of a
complete one, a lady might take some genus,
or some small natural order to illustrate, (as
for example the genus Ribes, or the order
Berberideæ,) and fill up the rest of her
grounds with hollies or other evergreens, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
as to form a back ground to the ornamental
trees. The genera Magnolia and Liriodendron
form the hardy trees of another small
order, which it would be easy to cultivate,
taking care to plant M. conspicua, and any
other that produces its flowers before it does
its leaves, with a rich background of evergreens.
The almond, which flowers in the
same manner, should be placed in a similar
situation; and standard roses may also be so
placed as to have the unsightliness of their
long naked stems greatly lessened by a mass
of evergreens behind.</p>

<p>Another very interesting mode of arrangement,
where the ground will admit of it, is
to plant particular situations with certain
trees which are not to be found in any other
part of the grounds; and thus to form what
the landscape gardeners call scenes. Thus,
for instance, there might be an American
ground, formed in some shaded hollow, and
planted with rhododendrons, azaleas, and
kalmias. All these plants require a light
peaty soil, and a shady and somewhat moist
situation. In another part of the pleasure-grounds
there might be some alpine scenery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
with pines and firs, and particularly larches,
interspersed with a few birch-trees, planted
in dry sandy soil on hilly ground. The
deciduous cypress and weeping willow should
be near water, as should the common willow,
nearly all the poplars, and the alders. In
another place might be a thicket of the different
varieties of hawthorn, with a few of
the fine large-fruited foreign thorns planted
in striking situations. In short there are no
limits to the numerous and beautiful scenes
that might be laid out by a woman of cultivated
mind, who possessed fancy and taste,
combined with a very slight knowledge of
trees; and I think I may safely add, that I do
not know a more delightful occupation than
this kind of landscape gardening. It is landscape
painting, but on the noblest and boldest
scale: and it is a source of constant enjoyment,
from the daily improvement that it
displays. What a difference it makes in the
pleasure we have in returning home, if we
have something to visit, that we know has
been improving in our absence. We regard
the trees and shrubs we have planted, and
the scenes we have laid out with almost a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
parental fondness; and a new and daily increasing
interest is given to life. I would,
therefore, most earnestly entreat my readers
to study trees and shrubs; and I do assure
them that they will find themselves amply
repaid, not only by the pleasure they will
have in landscape gardening, but in the additional
enjoyment their accession of knowledge
will give to every country walk and
ride that they take.</p>

<p>There is, however, one great drawback to
the pleasure that may be anticipated from
planting an arboretum, or even an illustration
of any particular order or genus; and
this is the very great difficulty that exists in
procuring plants true to their names. Nurserymen
put down a great many more names
in their catalogues, than they have different
kinds of plants; and thus the same plants,
like the actors in a country theatre, are often
made to perform under a great many different
names in the same piece. I have heard of
instances where twelve or fourteen species
were named in a catalogue, though the nurseryman
only possessed three or four, which,
when wanted, were made to do duty under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
all these different names. Almost all nurserymen
are alike in this respect, and the
only real cure will be an increased knowledge
of trees and shrubs on the part of the purchasers,
which will render it impossible to
impose false kinds upon them. In the mean
time I may mention that Mr. Loudon has
found the trees and shrubs in the nursery of
Messrs. Whitley and Osborn, at Fulham, more
correctly named than in most others.</p>

<p>In planting masses of trees and shrubs,
great care should be taken to hide the dug
ground around them, which always forms a
scar in the landscape. The best way of
doing this is to cover all the space between
the shrubs with grass, and to tie down the
branches of the trees to pegs or stakes fixed
in the earth, so as to make the trees feather
down to the ground. Where this cannot be
accomplished, on account of the expense of
clipping the grass, for it cannot be mown
among the trees, ivy may be pegged down over
the dug ground, or evergreen trailing roses,
of which there are many kinds especially
adapted for this purpose. There is one general
rule relating to the planting of trees and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
shrubs, which can never be too often repeated,
or too strongly enforced,—it is,
never to suffer them to be planted too
thickly. This may appear a very simple
rule, but it is one which it is very difficult to
put in practice, as all the persons employed
in planting are generally opposed to it. The
nurseryman of course wishes to dispose of
his plants, and the gardener to produce a good
effect as soon as possible, nay, even the proprietor
cannot help feeling the bare and desolate
appearance of a new plantation where the
shrubs are placed at proper distances. There
are but two remedies for this: either planting
so as to produce an effect at first, and then
thinning out half the plants, beginning the
second or third year; or planting the shrubs
at the proper distances, and covering the
ground between them with some trailing
plant pegged down.</p>

<p>Nothing can look worse than a row of
tall trees which were evidently planted for a
screen; but which, so far from answering the
intended purpose, admit the light between
their slender naked stems, which afford no
more concealment than the open rails of a paling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
Mr. Loudon observes, in one of the
numbers of the Gardener’s Magazine, that the
quickest way of thickening a plantation in
this state is, if the trees are deciduous, to cut
every alternate tree down, in order that the
stools of the fallen trees may send up young
shoots; but if any of them have branches
within six or eight feet of the ground, by
taking off the tops of the trees, and tying
down these branches, the plantation may be
thickened, without cutting any trees down.</p>

<p>A weeping ash is a very ornamental tree
on a lawn, but unless it is well trained it
loses its effect. When trained to a wooden
frame, the hoops and rods of which it is composed
are seldom strong enough to sustain
the weight of snow which falls on the summit
of the tree in severe winters, and if they
give way in any place, the boughs are frequently
broken. In the arboretum which
Joseph Strutt, Esq., is now having laid out at
Derby, and which, when finished, he is most
liberally about to present to that town as a
public promenade, there is a very fine weeping
ash, for which Mr. Strutt has had an iron
frame-work made. The iron rods are light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
and elegant, and yet so strong that they are
in no danger of giving way under any weight
of snow that is ever likely to fall on the tree.
The iron frame work has been coated over
with gas tar to preserve it from rust, and it
now looks exceedingly well.</p>

<p><i>Roses.</i>—These beautiful shrubs are so
generally admired, and they are grown so
universally in all gardens, that I think I
ought to give some especial directions for
their culture. In the first place, roses are
said to require removing every third year;
as their roots exude a great deal of matter
unfit for them to reabsorb, and as their fibrous
roots are few, small, and not widely extended
from the hole of the plant. It is not perhaps
necessary to take this rule strictly <i>au pied de
la lettre</i>, but it is as well to keep it in view,
and to remember that when rose trees look
sickly, or fail to produce a due proportion of
flowers, removing them to a fresh soil will
generally restore their vigour.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps generally known that
there are nearly two thousand species and
varieties of roses. Among such a chaos it
would be almost impossible to choose, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
not florists arranged them in about twenty
general divisions. One of the principal
of these contains the cabbage-roses and
their beautiful descendants, the moss-roses,
of which last there are more than twenty
kinds, some of which are very striking, and
particularly the dark crimson moss-rose,
generally called the Rouge de Luxembourg,
and the white moss, though the latter is
rather too delicate for a town garden. The
crested moss is also a curious variety, and it
is said to have been found growing out of an
old wall in Switzerland. All the kinds of
moss-roses should be planted in warm dry
situations, and in March a little manure
should be laid on the surface of the soil
round their roots. Should the season prove
dry, the plants should be frequently watered,
and the result will be a brilliant display of
flowers. There are twenty-five or thirty
other kinds of cabbage or Provence roses, all
of which are very fragrant, and indeed they
are the kinds used for making rose-water,
&amp;c.; they are all quite hardy, and require
no particular culture.</p>

<p>The autumn-flowering or perpetual roses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
are also remarkable both for their beauty and
their fragrance. There are more than fifty
sorts; one of the most beautiful of which is
Lee’s perpetual, the Rose du Roi of the
French. The Pæstum roses, mentioned by
Pliny, are supposed to belong to this family;
as does also the well known Rose des Quatre
Saisons. All these roses should be pruned
twice a-year, in November and in June; and
after pruning, the ground about their roots
should be loosened with a fork, and then
covered two or three inches deep with
manure, the manure being covered over
with some fresh green moss, to prevent it
from having an unpleasant appearance. The
roses of all the perpetual kinds frequently
fade without losing their petals; and when
this is the case the faded flowers should be
instantly removed. They are all propagated
by grafting on the common dog-rose,
as they do not readily take root from
layering. These roses are particularly valuable,
as with a little management they may
be kept in flower eight months in every
year.</p>

<p>The French, or Provins Roses, are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
widely opened flowers like the rose in
architecture. The striped and marbled roses
belong to this division. These roses have
scarcely any fragrance; but they have generally
showy flowers, and they are very hardy.
The druggists use them for making conserve
of roses; and for this purpose they are grown
in great quantities near the little town of
Provins in France, whence their name, which
is often confounded with that of the Provence
Roses from the south of France. The
white roses are hardy, and bloom abundantly
with very little care. The Scotch roses are
also remarkable for their hardiness, for their
blooming generally a fortnight earlier than
any others, and for their ripening abundance
of seed, from which new varieties may continually
be raised. The yellow Scotch rose
is very beautiful. Williams’s double yellow
sweetbriar, and the Austrian yellow or
copper-coloured rose are also well worth cultivating.
The latter is yellow on the outside
of the petal and red within. This rose will
not succeed well in a smoky atmosphere,
but it flowers beautifully in Mrs. Marryatt’s
flower-garden at Wimbledon, and in that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
R. H. Jenkinson, Esq., at Norbiton House,
near Kingston. The common double yellow
Rose, which seldom flowers well, should be
grown in a rich soil and warm situation, and
it requires abundance of air.</p>

<p>Of the climbing roses, the Ayrshire roses,
particularly the beautiful white flower called
the Queen of the Belgians, and Rosa ruga,
a very handsome and fragrant variety, are
perhaps the best for training upon frames to
form what are called pillars and pyramids of
roses, as they are quite hardy. For sheltered
situations Rosa multiflora, and its near ally
the Seven Sisters’ rose may be chosen; as they
grow very fast and very high, and produce
myriads of flowers, though they are easily
killed by frost. The most valuable climbing
roses are, however, the descendants of Rosa
sempervirens, the evergreen roses; and these
are the only kinds that should be used for pegging
down over the dug ground of a shrubbery.
They are of the easiest culture, as
they will grow under the drip of trees, and
they ought never to be pruned. Before
planting them the ground should be dug, and
well cleared from the roots of weeds, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
It should then be manured with part of an
old hot-bed, and the roses should be planted
about five feet apart. The following autumn
a good coating of manure should be laid
on the surface of the ground; and the plants
will require no after culture but pegging
down the shoots to prevent them from leaving
any part of the ground bare. The Triomphe
de Bollwiller is one of the best of roses for
this purpose. The Boursault division, one of
the best of which is the Rose de Lisle, may
be treated in the same manner. The noisette
roses are known by the great clusters of
flowers which they bear at the extremities
of their shoots. Their branches should not
be shortened, but the dead flowers should
be removed as soon as they fade.</p>

<p>The Banksia roses, the tea-scented kinds,
the Macartney and musk roses, are too tender
for any situation but a south wall. The best
roses in the neighbourhood of London are
to be found at Lee’s, Hammersmith, and
Loddige’s, Hackney. There are also very
fine collections at Rivers’s, Sawbridgeworth;
at Wood’s, Maresfield, and Hooker’s, Brenchley,
both near Tunbridge Wells; and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
especially at Lane’s, Berkhampstead,—the
latter nurseryman contriving, by means of
forcing, to have roses beautifully in flower
from the latter end of January to the middle
of November every year.</p>

<p>Roses are generally propagated by grafting
or budding, and also by making layers
and cuttings. In the latter case, the point
of the shoot should be taken off, and the
greater part of the leaves, to prevent an
access of evaporation. (For Illustration, see

</div>

<p class="c less sp">ROCK-WORK, MOSS-HOUSES, RUSTIC BASKETS,<br>
AND FOUNTAINS.</p>


<p><i>Rock-work</i>, though composed of somewhat
ponderous materials, is very frequently arranged
according to female taste; and one of
the most remarkable examples in England
(that at the Hoole, near Chester,) was designed
by a lady, and executed entirely
under her direction. There are many kinds
of rock-work; but they may be all described
as collections of fragments of rocks, stones,
flints, vitrified bricks, scoriæ, and similar
materials, so arranged as to afford a striking
object in the landscape; and, at the same
time, so as to form a number of little nests or
crevices for the reception of alpine plants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
The mode of arranging these materials depends
entirely upon taste; and of course
varies widely. The most natural kind of
rockwork, is like that at Redleaf, near Tunbridge
Wells; where Mr. Wells, the proprietor,
taking, what Mr. Loudon calls the
key-note, from the natural scenery of the
neighbourhood, has made his rocks appear
“to crop out” of the soil, as though naturally,
in such situations as to give the best effect
to the scenery. The plants deposited in the
hollows of these rocks, are so admirably
placed, and the art with which they are cultivated,
is so skilfully concealed, that no illusion
can be more complete; and we may fancy
ourselves in a scene of nature, but of nature
in her greatest beauty and highest luxuriance.</p>

<p>Very different is the rock-garden of the late
Duke of Marlborough, in his private gardens
at Blenheim. It is perhaps more beautiful
than the rocks at Redleaf; but no one could
possibly mistake it for anything but a work
of art, and it owes its chief beauty to the
plants grown in it. It is formed on a
scar in the natural rock, which is hewn
into zigzag paths; on one side of each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
which are numerous niches to receive the
plants. These plants are planted and kept
with great care; and they grow so luxuriously,
as almost to hide the paths, and to
make the rock look at a little distance like a
bank of flowers. Mosses of different colours
are interspersed, and the whole has a peculiarly
rich and sparkling effect.</p>

<p>The rock-work at Syon has been compared
to the scenery of a highland glen; but I
must confess there does not appear to me the
slightest resemblance. In fact, the Syon rock-work
is so overpowered by the magnificent
conservatory in front, with its splendid terrace,
and the geometric flower-garden at its
base, with its myriads of beautiful flowers, &amp;c.
that it becomes quite a secondary object, and
its real beauties are very apt to pass unnoticed.
It consists of masses of granite, intermixed
with broken capitals of columns, &amp;c.
thrown together in a natural manner, and
planted with ornamental flowering plants,
principally exotic. The rock-work at Norbiton
Hall, is disposed in the same manner
as that at Syon; but it is on a smaller scale;
and its principal use is to keep moisture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
round the roots of the plants, which are
planted among it.</p>

<p>Many other specimens of rock-work might
be mentioned, particularly that of the Rev.
J. Clowes at Lower Boughton Hall, near
Manchester, that of Mrs. Lawrence at Drayton,
that of the late Duke of Bedford at Woburn,
and that of Thomas Millie, Esq. at St.
Clair Town, in Perthshire; but the most remarkable
of all is that of Lady Boughton, at
the Hoole, near Chester, which, indeed,
stands quite alone, the only one of its kind.
The design for this rock-work was taken
from a small model, representing the mountains
of Savoy, with the valley of Chamouni;
and the rocks are made sufficiently large to
give a person walking among them, an idea
of their reality. The labour of forming this
rock-work was very great; not only from the
large size of the stones to be removed, but
from the difficulty of getting them of the
proper colours and shapes. Besides this, it
was very difficult to make it stand against
the weather. “Rain washed away the soil,
and frost swelled the stones: and several
times the main wall failed from the weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
put upon it. The walls and foundations are
built of the red sandstone of the country;
and the other materials have been collected
from various quarters, chiefly from Wales.”
The part that represents the outer circle of
rocks, is principally composed of the red
sandstone of the neighbourhood, in which
little niches have been made for plants, and
filled with exactly the kind of soil in which
alpine plants grow naturally; viz., broken
fragments of stones, clean-washed river
gravel, and the debris of decaying moss, and
other plants, crumbling rocks, &amp;c. The
plants are all strictly alpine—the only liberty
taken, being the mingling of the alpine plants
of hot and cold countries, or rather of different
elevations, together; and this is contrived
very ingeniously, by placing fragments
of dark-stone to absorb the heat, round those
that require most warmth, and fragments of
white stone to reflect the heat, round those
that require to be kept cool. In all the trees
and shrubs planted among the rocks, the
same care is taken to keep up the illusion:
they are all alpine plants; and dwarf species,
or those of very slow growth, are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
chosen, to prevent them from becoming too
large for the rocks. The part which represents
the “Mer de Glace,” is “worked with
grey limestone, quartz, and spar. It has no
cells for plants; but the spaces are filled
up with broken fragments of white marble,
to look like snow; and the spar is to imitate
the glaciers.” I have already mentioned that
Lady Boughton was her own artist; and, I
may add, that the rock-work was six or eight
years in progress, before it was completed.</p>

<p>Whatever kind of rock-work may be
erected, the first thing to be done is to make
a secure foundation; as, unless this is effected,
the stones will gradually sink into the earth
by their own weight; and thus, in a few
years, the mass will either have become half
buried, or tottering and insecure. It is therefore
most prudent, unless the rock-work be
actually erected on a solid rock, to prepare
a foundation for it of brick-work; not suffering,
however, any of the wall to appear
above the surface of the ground. To prevent
the possibility of this foundation wall being
seen, it will be best not to carry it higher
than to within six or eight inches of the surface.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
All being prepared, the stones may
be arranged, the largest at the base; and the
upper ones diversified according to the taste
of the designer.</p>

<p>The following general rules will apply to
all the different kinds of rock-work:—never
to let the stones rest against any kind of
building; as, when so disposed, they give
ideas of disorder and insecurity. Never to
mix up decaying materials, such as roots of
trees, &amp;c. with durable materials, such as
rocks and stones; or things evidently natural,
with those evidently formed by art. Never
to let the rock-work rise abruptly out of the
turf, like a great mass of stones discharged
from a cart; but gradually to prepare the
way for it, by sinking some fragments of
stone half-way in the ground, and letting
them become larger and more numerous, till
the spectator at last arrives at the principal
mass. Never to begin to work without
having some fixed design, whether avowedly
artificial or apparently natural; and where
the design is to make what may be called a
natural rock-garden, like that of the Duke of
Marlborough at Blenheim, always to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
care that the stones are very large, and piled
upon one another, so as to imitate the stratification
of a rocky country.</p>

<p>“In general,” says Mr. Loudon, in his
<i>Suburban Gardener</i>, “rock-work, to be truly
natural, can only show the rock on one
side, or at most on two sides; as scars, cliffs,
and precipices are seen in rocky districts.”
This abrupt side or face of the rock should
be represented as projecting into ledges or
shelves, to imitate the terminations of the
different strata; and the flowering plants
should be introduced, in what may be supposed
to be the clefts and fissures of the natural
rock. The summit of the rock and the
sloping side should be covered with turf,
and may be planted with trees, some of
which may hang over the rock; or the line
of junction between the stones and the turf
may be concealed, by the luxuriance of the
alpine plants, planted in the fissures, and
suffered to climb over the top. It must be
observed, however, that in granite or basalt
rocks, the lines of stratification are generally
vertical; and consequently very ill adapted
for forming ledges for plants. The best materials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
for a natural rock-garden in ledges
are therefore sandstone and limestone, the
lines of stratification in which are chiefly
horizontal, with occasional dips.</p>

<p>It will be evident, from what has been
said, that to make good rock-work, requires
the eye of an artist; and it may be added, that
rock-work should never be attempted without
first making a coloured drawing of it on
paper, or a small model, with a child’s box of
bricks, or some similar materials, to try the
effect.</p>

<p><i>Moss-houses</i> are interesting as garden buildings,
because they afford great scope to the
exercise of the fancy; not only in the design
for the entire building, but for the arrangement
of the moss in different patterns. The
first thing to be considered in carrying the
design into execution, is the foundation; and
this, if the soil be damp, should be dug out
two feet deep, and nearly filled with concrete.
In this must be fixed the rustic pillars
which are to support the roof; and these
are generally composed of the trunks of
young larches or spruce-firs with their bark
on, which should be chosen as nearly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
possible of the same size. The number
of pillars and the manner in which they
are to be arranged depends, of course, on
the design; but the general number is from
eight to twelve. Great care must be taken
to drive the posts firmly into the ground, and
all to the same depth. The rafters for the
roof are then fixed on, and narrow laths,
or hazel rods, nailed between them, and also
between the uprights. Between these laths
or rods the moss is pushed with a wedge-shaped
piece of wood; the pattern having
been first rudely traced with chalk on the
outside of the rods. The moss to be used
should be first collected and sorted, all of the
same kind being put together; and when it
is used the root end should always be the
part pushed in between the rods. The principal
mosses fit for this purpose are the reindeer
moss, Cenomyce rangifera, and its allies,
many of which are found in abundance on
Bagshot Heath, and other commons near
London, and nearly all of which are white:
the different kinds of Bryum, all of which are
very neat and compact growing mosses,
sending up long stalks bearing their seedpods;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
of these, Bryum roseum is pink, B.
hornum yellowish green, and B. cuspidatum
light green: Dicranum glaucum nearly yellow,
and D. scoparium a very dark green:
Sphagnum, one kind pink, and another nearly
white; and Hypnum, several species, varying
in different shades of green. All these are
abundant in the commons about London.
Farther north, more brilliant colours are
found, some very dark brown, some of a
rich brownish purple, some of a very bluish
green, and some so white as to look like snow.
Wherever there is a common or very old
turf, it will be an amusement to explore it in
search of the different kinds of mosses; and
when the prevailing mosses of the district
have been discovered, the pattern and colours
for the moss-house can be arranged accordingly.
A very rich, and at the same time
original effect, might be produced in a moss-house,
by arranging the moss in an arabesque
pattern, with different colours combined
something like those of a Turkey carpet;
and instead of paving the floor it might be
formed in the same manner as the walls. Or,
the walls might be of some plain colour with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
only the crest of the family, or the initials of
the designer’s name in white or colours, and
the ceiling and floor in arabesque.</p>

<p>In all cases the outside of the roof is thatched
or covered with shingles; and the outside of
the walls is either boarded or covered with
a thick coating of moss. Where the house
is large, or if there are glass windows, it is
best to have the frame-work made by a
regular carpenter; but where the moss-house
is small, and open in front, it may be
put up by the gardener, or any intelligent
servant. In many cases, the roof is finished
with a circle of pine-cones fixed round it as
a cornice; and the floor is either laid with
other pine-cones, or with small pebbles, some
of which are white and are arranged in a kind
of pattern; the windows are frequently of
coloured glass; and a curious effect might
be produced by having those in the back of
the building purple, which would make the
ground and every object seen through them
look as if covered with snow; and those in
front of the building filled with yellow glass,
which gives every object the rich glow of
summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p><i>The seats</i> in a garden or pleasure-ground
are generally purchased ready made; but an
agreeable variety may be occasionally produced,
by having the stump of an old tree
formed into a seat, and twining ivy, and creeping
flowering shrubs, round it. Where it is
an object to save trouble, a plant of the Virginian
creeper may be planted with one of
the giant ivy; and if both are left to nature,
the effect will be very good, as the brilliant
deep red of the Virginian creeper in autumn
will be relieved by the dark green of the ivy.
A few moveable seats—one to wheel about
from one part of the garden to another, and
another of the new folding kind, imported
from Norway by Charlwood, and sold at
3s. 6d. each, are very convenient. Where
there is a terrace, a seat may be erected at
each end of wood, but of a somewhat massive
design, and painted white, being strewed
while the paint is wet with very fine sand,
which will make it a good imitation of stone.
Seats may also be decorated by nailing on a
wooden frame-work hazel rods with the bark
on, which have been stained of different
colours, and then varnished. These rods are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
arranged in a pattern, and I have seen the
effect of a landscape produced; but it appears
a kind of decoration that is in very doubtful
taste, or at least one that it requires great
judgment to manage properly.</p>

<p><i>Rustic Baskets.</i>—There are perhaps few
things over which the alchemy of taste has
more power than the apparently worthless
materials of which these elegant ornaments
are constructed, An old cask, a few pine-cones,
and a few pieces of rope, combined by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>skilful hands, will produce an almost magical
effect. The baskets at Dropmore were all
constructed in this manner from designs by
Lady Grenville. As an example of what
may be done with the commonest materials
in this way, Fig. 1. is an old Chinese tea-chest,
with part of a tree sawn through as a
pedestal, and some pieces of rope nailed on
as decorations. Fig. 2. is an old basket
with all its interstices stuffed with moss.
Many other articles might be devised, which
any person of taste and invention would
find it an agreeable occupation to design,
and to superintend the execution of. In
addition to these rustic baskets, a few wirework<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
frames might be designed of much
more elegant forms than those commonly
sold, which an intelligent gardener might be
easily instructed to make at his leisure hours;
and indeed a lady with two pair of small
pincers would find no great difficulty in
twisting the wire herself. The great point
is to exercise our own skill and ingenuity;
for we all feel so much more interested in
what we do ourselves than in what is done
for us, that no lady is likely to become fond
of gardening, who does not do a great deal
with her own hands.</p>

<p><i>Fountains.</i>—Though fountains are more
suitable to a hot country than to a weeping
climate like that of England, yet it must
be confessed they are generally a great improvement
to garden scenery. The first
thing to be considered before erecting one,
is where to make the reservoir; as on the
elevation which that is above the garden, depends
the height to which the water of the
fountain will ascend. The length of time
which the fountain will play depends on the
quantity of water contained in the reservoir,
but this has nothing to do with the height to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
which the water will rise. If a cistern be
formed on the top of a summer-house, ten
feet and a half high, and a pipe from that be
carried down a sufficient depth into the
ground to secure it from frost, and thence
horizontally to the orifice which is to form
the fountain, that orifice, if it be only half an
inch in diameter, will throw up a jet of
water ten feet high, and will continue playing
till all the water in the cistern is exhausted.
The conducting pipe for such a
fountain should be two inches and a quarter
in diameter, and it should be furnished with
a valve or stop-cock, which may be turned
at pleasure, and by which the water may be
either suffered to ascend through the orifice,
or retained in the conducting pipe. The
reservoir cistern must be kept full by a
forcing pump, or hydraulic ram; or, in the
neighbourhood of London, by high service
from the water company which supplies the
dwelling. Any cistern, sufficiently high
above the garden, will do. Where a cistern
in the roof is supplied with a high service
pipe, a fountain with a jet thirty or forty
feet high, according to the height of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
house, might be had in the garden at no
other expence than that of fixing descending,
and horizontal conducting pipes.</p>

<p>The water in a fountain may be thrown
up in various designs, which are formed by
little tubes of brass, called adjutages, which
are screwed on the orifice of the conducting
pipe. Some of these designs imitate a convolvulus,
some a wheat-sheaf, some a basket,
and some a globe. In short, they are very
numerous, and after exhausting the fancy of
the English plumbers, a variety of different
and very elegant designs may be obtained
from Paris.</p>

</div>

<p class="c less sp">WINDOW GARDENING, AND THE MANAGEMENT<br>
OF PLANTS IN POTS IN SMALL GREEN-HOUSES.</p>


<p><i>The management of plants in rooms</i> is extremely
difficult, from the want of proper
light and pure air: though this latter want
may, in some measure, be obviated, by opening
the window in front of which the plants
stand, whenever circumstances will permit.
It should never be forgotten that fresh air is
almost as essential to plants as water; and
that they are seriously injured by being
forced to inspire air at their breathing pores
that is in an unfit state for them. I have often
observed the healthy appearance of plants
belonging to cottagers; and I believe it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
arises principally from the habit that most
poor people have, of setting their plants out
in the rain whenever there is a shower.
This not only clears the leaves of dust, and
opens the stomata or breathing pores, but
gives the plant abundance of fresh air.
Without a sufficiency of air and light, plants
will soon become weak and sickly, and their
leaves will turn yellow; but if a little fresh
air be given to them every day when the
temperature is not too cold, they will grow
quite as well in a room as in a green-house.</p>

<p>Another reason why plants kept in rooms
are generally unhealthy, is, that they are
watered in a very irregular manner. Sometimes
they are suffered to become so dry that
the mould in which they grow will crumble
under the pressure of the finger, and the
spongioles of the roots are quite withered;
and then a profusion of water is given to
them, quite cold from the pump, though
they have probably been standing in a temperature
of from 60° to 70°. As a climax,
part of this water is suffered to remain in
the saucer for a day or two, till even the
healthy part of the roots is thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
chilled, and the plant, if of a delicate nature,
is destroyed. The reverse of all this should
be the case. The plant should never be
suffered to become so dry as to have the
mould in a crumbling state; but if such a
circumstance has been suffered to occur, it
should be well watered with warm water of
at least the temperature of the room, and
better if rather warmer. Enough of this
water should be given to fill the saucer; in
order that every part of the mould and of
the roots may imbibe some benefit from
the moisture; but as soon as this has been
done, the pot should be lifted out of the
saucer, and the water thrown away, as
nothing can be more injurious to the roots
of most plants, than to have the pot they
grow in, kept standing in water. There are,
however, some exceptions to this rule, such
as all the kinds of Mimulus, the Hydrangea,
Calla ethiopica, and some kinds of Calceolaria.
All these, and all marsh plants, require
abundance of water, and will not
flower well unless the saucer be kept half
full, though the water should be changed
every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>It is also a common fault to put plants
kept in rooms, into too large pots; or, as the
gardeners express it, to over-pot them. This
has always a bad effect. If the soil be good,
and not over-watered, the plants will indeed
grow rapidly; but it will be to produce leaves
and branches instead of flowers: and if the
soil be over-watered, the mass of soddened
soil round the roots has the same effect upon
them as stagnant water in the saucer. The
soil should always be in such a state as to
admit air with the water to the roots; and
this it cannot do when it becomes a blackened
paste by being saturated with water. At
the same time frequent repotting is often
absolutely necessary to keep the plants in a
dwarf compact habit of growth, and to prevent
them from being drawn up. The way
in which gardeners ascertain when repotting
is necessary, is by turning the plant out of
its pot with the ball of earth attached; and
if they find the roots look white round the
outside of the mould, then the plant should
be transferred to a larger pot; but only one
size larger: afterwards it may be repotted
again if necessary, but always to a pot only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
a little larger than the one it was taken from.
By persevering in this mode of treatment
for some time, and never advancing more
than one size at a time, a plant may be
grown to a large size, and made to produce
abundance of flowers; while by the contrary
treatment, that is, suffering it to remain in a
very small pot, or shifting it suddenly into a
very large one, the stem will become weakened
and elongated, and the flowers will be
few and very poor. In short, on the skilful
management of repotting, or shifting, as the
gardeners call it, a great deal of the art of
growing plants in pots depends.</p>

<p><i>The best soil for plants in pots</i> is generally peat
mixed with vegetable mould and sand; and the
pots should be filled nearly a quarter of their
depth with little bits of broken pots, called
potshreds, so as to ensure complete drainage.
When plants are shifted, they are turned out
of their old pots with their balls of earth
entire; the roots are then examined, and if
any are wounded or decayed they should be
cut off. The new pot has then a layer of
potshreds placed at the bottom with a little
earth, and the plant is placed in the centre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
so that the bole or collar may be just above
the level of the rim. The new earth is then
put in, and the pot shaken to make it settle.
The plant is then slightly watered, and set
aside in the shade for the rest of the day.
Plants should never be repotted when in
flower; the best time is indeed when they
are growing, till their flower buds begin to
swell, when they should be allowed to remain
undisturbed till the flowering season is completely
over. Sometimes the soil in a pot
looks black, and covered with moss. When
this is the case, the plant should be turned
out of the pot, and the black sodden earth
partly shaken off the roots, which should be
pruned, and should have all their decayed
parts cut off. The plant should then be
repotted in another pot of the same, or nearly
the same, size as the one it was taken from,
which should be well drained, and filled up
with a compost of vegetable mould, sand,
and peat. Thus treated, and only moderately
but regularly watered with warm
water, which should never be allowed to
stand in the saucer, the plant will soon
recover; and if judiciously pruned in, if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
has become elongated, it will become handsome,
and what gardeners call well grown.</p>

<p>Another objection to growing plants in
rooms is the great difficulty that exists in
keeping them clear of insects; particularly
the Aphis or green fly, and the kind of mite,
(Acarus tellarius) commonly called the red
spider. These are generally destroyed by
fumigation; and the best mode of fumigating
them is by Clark’s Patent Blower, with
the fumigator attached, which has been already
described. Washing with a syringe
and abundance of water is, however, probably
a better mode; as it has been often
observed that neither the green fly nor the
red spider will ever infest a plant, that is
frequently syringed.</p>

<p><i>The management of plants in a small green-house</i>
differs very little from that of plants in
rooms. Whenever the weather will permit,
air should be given if only for half an hour
in the middle of the day. The house should
be kept clean, and free from dead leaves;
and the plants should not be too much
crowded. Nothing can look worse than
pale sickly green-house plants, drawn up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
to an unnatural length, and so weak that
their stems will not stand upright without
the aid of a stick. When green-houses are
crowded with plants, some of which are too
far from the light, this must be the case; and
when it is, it is quite hopeless to expect
either healthy plants or fine flowers. Though
it is adviseable to have saucers to the pots of
plants kept in rooms, for the sake of cleanliness,
it is much better for those kept in
the green-house to be without them. As
different green-house plants require a somewhat
different treatment, the following directions
for the management of a few of the
most popular may be useful to my readers.</p>

<p><i>Camellias.</i>—The Camellia is a plant which
requires abundance of water, and is yet soon
killed by suffering stagnant moisture to remain
about the roots. When grown in pots
there should be abundant drainage; that is,
the pots should be more than a quarter
filled with potshreds. The soil should be
peat earth, mixed earth, and sand; and the
plants should be potted high, so as to let the
collar of the plant be quite above the rim of
the pot. The pots should not have saucers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
or if they have for the sake of cleanliness,
the water should be carefully poured out of
them immediately after the plants have been
watered. The plants should be watered
abundantly every day while their flower-buds
are swelling, as if this be neglected,
the buds are very apt to drop off. When
the flowers begin to expand, the watering
is not of so much consequence, though it
should be continued in moderate quantities;
and abundance should be again given when
the plants are making their young shoots.
After they have done growing, watering
once or twice a week will be sufficient till
the flower-buds again begin to swell. During
the growing season the plants should be
set out and syringed all over the leaves once
or twice a week; but care should be taken
not to do this when the sun shines, or at any
rate not to set the plants in the sun while
they are wet, as the heat of the sun acting
on the water, will scald the leaves, and make
them appear blotched, and partially withered.
The roots of Camellias are seldom very
strong, and they are very easily injured.
Great care should, therefore, be taken when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
the plants are repotted not to bruise the
roots, or to cut off all that are at all injured.
If on turning out the plants previous to
repotting, the ball of earth has no white roots
appearing on the outside, the earth and
decayed roots should be shaken or cleared
away, till good roots are seen; and these
should be carefully examined, and all the bad
parts cut away. The plants should then be
repotted in a pot not more than an inch in
diameter more than the diameter of the ball
of earth left round the sound roots; and it
should be well drained at the bottom with
very small potshreds, or clean gravel. Small
Camellias should not be shifted oftener than
once in two years; and large ones, that is,
those above five feet high, not oftener than
once in three or four years; but if the earth
in the pot appears to have sunk, a little vegetable
mould may be laid on the surface. The
usual time for shifting Camellias is just when
they have done flowering, before they are
beginning to send out their young shoots.
When planted in the free ground in a conservatory,
they will require no other care
than regular watering, and syringing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
leaves once or twice a week. When planted
in the open air, the roots should be carefully
protected by straw during frosty weather.
There are some Camellias in the Vauxhall
Nursery, (Messrs. Chandler’s,) which have
been treated in this manner, and have stood
out for several years. The hardiest kinds
and the most suitable for planting in the
open air, are the single red, the double red,
and the double white. The magnificent
Camellia reticulata is also said to be tolerably
hardy. The tenderest of the common
kinds are the beautiful apple-flowered variety
of C. Sasanqua, and the single variety of this
species, the flower of which resembles that of
the tea-plant. These plants are both of low
growth, and ought always to be kept in pots.</p>

<p><i>Geraniums or Pelargoniums.</i>—The beautiful
green-house shrubs which we are accustomed
to call Geraniums, have, in fact, been
long separated from that genus, and formed
into a new one called Pelargonium. The
difference is in the shape of the seed vessel;
that of the Pelargonium being like a stork’s
bill, and that of the Geranium like a crane’s
bill. Both are nearly allied to the Touch-me-not;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
and when the seed is ripe, the
valves of the seed pod burst asunder and
curl up. There are almost innumerable
species, hybrids, and varieties of Pelargoniums
grown in our green-houses, so mixed
up together by hybridizing, that it is very
difficult even to class them. One of the
hardiest kinds, which has numerous descendants,
is the Horse-shoe Geranium, Pelargonium
zonale; and another, P. inquinans,
is the common scarlet. The rose-scented
Geranium, P. graveolens, and oak-leaved,
P. quercifolium, with their numerous descendants,
the flowers of which are all crimson,
striped with brown so very dark that it looks
almost black, are also tolerably hardy. All
the shrubby kinds which are generally
kept in green-houses, require a rich loamy
soil, that is, about half very rotten dung,
and half sandy loam, to make them produce
fine flowers. When the flowering season is
over, the plants are cut down, and cuttings
made from them. (See page 82.) When
these have struck, they are potted in a compost
of vegetable mould and sand, and continue
in this soil till February or March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
when they are repotted in rich soil for
flowering. Some gardeners throw away the
old plants as soon as they have made the
cuttings; but others take the old plants out
of their pots, and shaking the earth from
them, prune the roots, and repot the plants
in smaller pots. Pelargoniums require a
great deal of air; and when about to flower
they should have a great deal of water, but
at other seasons very little. They are killed
with the slightest frost; and are very liable
to damp off, if watered too much, and not
allowed sufficient air in winter. Air is, indeed,
quite essential to them.</p>

<p><i>Heaths.</i>—The kinds grown in green-houses
are all natives of the Cape of Good Hope,
and they are very numerous; but they may
be classed under six heads, which are named
from the shape of their flowers. These
divisions are tubular-shaped, ventricose,
spreading or salver shaped, with an inflated
calyx, globular, and ovate. They all require
to be potted high, and to be grown
in three parts of peat earth to one of fine
white sand, or in what is emphatically called
heath mould. The fine hair-like roots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
heaths cannot penetrate a stiff loamy soil,
and manure would be too gross for their
spongioles to take up. The collar of the
plant should always be above the soil, as it
is very easily rotted by moisture. Heaths
require good drainage, and frequent waterings;
and though the water should never
be allowed to stand in the saucer, the roots
should also never be allowed to become quite
dry, as when once withered, they are not
easily recovered. Heaths also require abundance
of free air, and no plants are more
injured by being kept in rooms. They
should not be shifted oftener than once in
three or four years. They are propagated by
cuttings taken from the tips of the shoots,
and then struck in pure white sand. The
pots containing the cuttings should be plunged
up to the rim in a hot-bed, and each should
be covered with a bell glass. Heaths are
easily killed by frost, which acts upon them
by splitting, or rather shivering their stems.</p>

<p><i>Verbenas.</i>—No family of plants better rewards
the care of the cultivator, and none
can be more beautiful than the Verbenas.
The old scarlet Verbena melindres, or, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
is frequently called, V. chamædrifolia, is the
most brilliant of all the kinds, though it is
one of the most tender: it is a prostrate
plant, and when pegged down, it is well
adapted for covering a bed in a geometric
flower garden; or it may be planted in a vase,
or rustic flower-basket to hang down over the
sides. Verbena Tweediana is an upright
growing plant, and though the flowers, which
are crimson, are not half so brilliant as those
of V. melindres, the plant has the great advantage
of being one of the hardiest of all
the kinds. V. melindres latifolia, and V.
mel. splendens are both hardier than their
parent, and they unite its brilliant colour,
with the upright habit of Tweediana. V.
incisa has pale pink flowers, and an upright
habit of growth. It is tolerably hardy,
and grows freely, but its flowers have a
faded look. V. Arraniana has an upright
habit of growth, and purple flowers, with
very dark bluish-green leaves. It is very
tender, and very apt to be attacked by a
kind of aphis, and other insects. V. Aubletia,
V. Lambertii, and V. Sabinii are prostrate
tufted half herbaceous kinds, all hardy. V.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
Neillii has lilac flowers, and rather an upright
habit of growth; and V. teucroides is a
coarse-growing plant, with a long spike of
white flowers, which turn pink in dying off,
which has been much more praised than it
deserves. There is also a yellowish kind, V.
sulphurea; V. venosa, a very strong-growing
species, with purple flowers, and many other
species, hybrids, and varieties. All the Verbenas
require to be grown in sand and peat,
or heath-mould, and to be kept moderately
watered: they all strike readily from cuttings
or layers; and, indeed, when pegged down
without any slitting or twisting, most of the
shrubby kinds will throw out roots at every
joint. When worm casts are observed on the
surface of the pot, as will very often be the
case, the plant, with its ball of earth entire,
may be turned out of the pot, and the worms,
which will always be found on the outside
of the ball may be picked off. Worms do
considerable injury to plants, especially such
as are in pots, by rupturing the fibres and impeding
the free percolation of the water, besides
giving the surface of the earth in the
pot, a very unpleasant appearance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
flowers of the Verbenas should always be cut
off as soon as they wither. The Lemon
plant, Verbena triphylla, now called Aloysia
citriodora, is remarkable for the sweetness of
the odour of its leaves. It is tolerably hardy;
but requires great care in watering; as the
leaves will soon curl up and wither if it has
too little, and they will drop off if it has too
much. The flower has no beauty; and the
only recommendation of the plant is the delightful
fragrance of its leaves.</p>

<p><i>Petunias</i> may be raised, either from seed
or cuttings, as they seed freely, and strike
readily. The first kind introduced was the
white-flowered kind, Petunia nyctaginiflora,
which is an abundant flowerer, and very fragrant.
Petunia phœnicea, or violacea, is
another original species, and from these
nearly all the myriads of hybrids and varieties
have arisen. These Petunias hybridize
freely with each other, and most of the
kinds produce abundance of seed. P. bicolor
is a different species, and does not either mix
well with the others, or seed freely. Petunias
may be treated as annuals, and raised on a
slight hot-bed every year from seed; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
thus treated, they will do very well in the
open ground. In warm dry situations, they
may even be suffered to sow themselves in
the open ground, and will come up and
flower abundantly. Treated as green-house
plants, they are, however, all shrubby, and
will last several years. When intended to
be kept in pots, the seed should be sown on
a slight hot-bed in February, and the young
plants pricked out into very small thumb
pots, as they are called, while in the seed
leaf. In these pots they should remain
either in the frame of the hot-bed, or in a
room, or green-house, for about a week or
ten days, and they should be then shifted
into somewhat larger pots. These shiftings,
always into somewhat larger pots, should be
repeated six, eight, or ten times, if the plants
are wanted to be bushy; and not more than
four, if the plants are wished to grow tall.
The bushy plants will flower abundantly,
without any support; but the tall-growing
plants, which are suffered to flower in comparatively
small pots, must be trained to some
kind of frame. When the tall plants appear
growing too straggling, the extremities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
the shoots should be taken off and made into
cuttings. Petunias may be grown in any
good garden soil; and require no particular
attention as to watering, &amp;c. In fact, they
are, perhaps, the best of all plants for a lady
to cultivate; as they will afford a great deal
of interest and amusement, with the least
possible amount of trouble.</p>

<p><i>Fuchsias</i> are another family of plants that
may be cultivated with very little trouble.
Fuchsia globosa is at once the hardiest and
the handsomest kind. F. virgata is also tolerably
hardy. All the Fuchsias require a
light, rich soil, or a mixture of rich sandy
loam and peat; and regular watering, as when
the outer roots are once withered, either by
want of moisture, or by exposure of the pot
to the direct rays of the sun, the plant generally
dies. For this reason the Fuchsia is
not so well adapted for a window plant, as
many others. Fuchsia fulgens differs considerably
from the other species, and will not
flower well unless in the open ground, and
with a sunny exposure. It is also tuberous
rooted, though woody in its stem. It is
easily propagated; and even a leaf taken off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
without injuring the part of the petiole which
was attached to the stem, has been known to
grow and form a plant. Several handsome
hybrids have been produced, by applying the
pollen of F. fulgens to the stigma of F. globosa,
F. conica, and F. gracilis. It may here
be mentioned, that whenever hybrids are to
be raised, by fertilizing one plant with the
pollen of another, the anthers of the flower
that is to produce the seed, should be removed
with a pair of scissors, before they
burst. The pollen from the other flower
which is to form the hybrid, should be afterwards
applied with a camel-hair pencil to
the stigma of the flower, which is to produce
the seed; and a bit of thread should be tied
round the flower-stalk, in order that the
seed-pod may be saved, and set apart. All
hybrids may be made in the same manner;
but it must always be remembered that
flowers will not hybridize properly, unless
they are naturally nearly allied.</p>

<p><i>Calceolarias.</i>—Perhaps no plants have ever
been hybridized more extensively than these.
The principal parents of the numerous and
splendid plants that we are continually seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
produced, are C. corymbosa, and C. arachnoidea,
the one a yellow, and the other a
purple flower; but there are many other
species that have been crossed and re-crossed
with these, so as to form a very great variety.
C. bicolor has a very large pale yellow-and-white
flower; and it has been the parent of
some very fine hybrids and varieties. All
the calceolarias require rather a rich soil;
and the usual compost is two parts of thoroughly
rotten dung, one part of leaf mould,
or old turf, and one part of white sand. The
ingredients of this compost should be well
mixed together, and broken fine, but not
sifted. All the Calceolarias require plenty
of water, and abundance of light and air;
and they will all flower best when planted in
the open ground. They are, however, very
subject to be attacked by a kind of aphis;
and when kept in pots, they should be frequently
syringed.</p>

<p><i>Myrtles</i> should be grown in a soil composed
of peat and loam, in which the former predominates;
they should be regularly watered,
and frequently syringed. Some persons nip
off the tips of the young shoots, to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
the plants grow bushy; and though it has
this effect, it is a bad practice with the
flowering kinds, as it prevents them from
flowering. A better plan is to make cuttings,
and first to plant them in very small
pots, gradually changing them into larger
ones, till the plants have acquired a bushy
habit of growth.</p>

<p><i>Mimulus.</i>—Some of the kinds of plants of
this genus are very handsome, particularly
the hybrids raised by the nurserymen from
M. cardinalis, M. roseus, M. luteus, and M.
guttatus. These species are all herbaceous,
and all natives of South America, Mexico,
and California. They are all nearly hardy,
and though generally grown in a green-house,
they will stand quite well in the open air,
dying down to the ground in winter, but
sending up fresh and very vigorous shoots in
spring. When these plants are grown in the
open ground it should be in a shady moist
situation; and when they are kept in pots,
they should always stand in saucers half full
of water. This water should, however, be
changed every day, and when given to the
plants it should always be as nearly as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
of the same temperature as themselves.
The little musk plant, Mimulus moschata,
requires the same treatment as its more
showy brethren. As all the species of Mimulus
have been found in their native habitats
growing in coarse sand or gravel on the
brink of a river, this kind of soil should be
chosen for them in pots; and the soil in
which they are grown can hardly be too
poor, provided they have abundance of
water. In Chili, the inhabitants eat the
leaves as a kind of vegetable. The shrubby
kinds of Mimulus; viz., the common monkey
plant, M. luteus, and the scarlet-flowered
species, M. puniceus, are now considered to
belong to a new genus called Diplacus. They
are both natives of California; and in their
treatment they should be considered as green-house
plants, and have rather a better soil,
and less water than the true kinds of Mimulus.</p>

<p><i>Hydrangea Hortensia</i> is another plant, that
when grown in a pot, requires to have the
saucer kept half full of water. There are
several species, most of which are hardy
shrubs, but Hydrangea Hortensia, the kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
usually called the Hydrangea, is a native of
China, and only half hardy, though it will
live in the open air in sheltered situations,
or with a very slight protection. This plant
was named Hortensia by the botanist Commerson
in compliment to Madame Hortense
Lapeaute, the wife of a French watchmaker.
The Hydrangea, when the colour
of its flower is to be pink, should be grown
in a rich loamy soil; but when the colour of
the flower is wished to be blue it should be
grown in peat. In both cases the plant
should be pruned every year, and the old
wood cut out; so that the wood which is to
produce the flowering shoots should never
be more than two or at most three years old.
Cuttings strike readily at any season when
the plant is in a growing state; if put into a
rich soil and kept moist they will root in a
fortnight, and flower in a month.</p>

<p><i>Succulent plants.</i>—There are very few things
in gardening respecting which gardeners appear
more to disagree than in the treatment of
succulent plants. Nearly all these plants
are natives of the sandy plains in the neighbourhood
of the Cape of Good Hope, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
they are subjected to alternate seasons of
extreme wet and extreme dryness. Cultivators
attempting to imitate this, have grown
their plants in poor sandy soil, and kept
them entirely without water at one season,
while they have been inundated with it at
another. The fact is, that when we attempt
to imitate nature, we should remember that the
attempt is useless unless we can do so in every
particular; and also that the plants we have to
cultivate, have been nursed up into so very
artificial a state, that if they were transplanted
to their native plains they would probably
perish, like a poor Canary bird, which a
mistake of philanthropy has turned out of
the cage in which it has long lived. For
this reason, we must adopt the mode of
treating succulents, which the best gardeners
find most successful, without troubling ourselves
to discover why it is so different from
the natural habit of the plants. This mode
of treatment is, then, to grow the plants in a
rich loamy soil, kept open, as it is called, by
the addition of lime rubbish; and to give
the plants water all the year, but more moderately
when they are in a dormant, than when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
they are in a growing state. They should
also have as much air and light as possible.
The water should never be suffered to stand
in the saucer of any succulent plant; but
it should be given regularly, diminishing the
quantity a little every day as the season for
rest approaches. If the water be suddenly
stopped the leaves of the plants will shrink
and become flaccid, and when this is the
case, the plant generally dies. A deficiency
of air on the other hand will cause the plant
to damp off. All succulent plants are very
soon affected by frost.</p>

<p><i>The Australian plants</i>, of which so many
beautiful kinds have been introduced within
the last few years, should nearly all be grown
in a mixture of sand and peat; and they
should have their pots filled one-third with
potshreds. They all require abundance of
water, but they will all perish if water is
retained about their roots. Most of the
Australian plants are very tenacious of life,
and if cut down when they appear dead,
they will generally spring up again from the
collar or the roots.</p>

<p><i>The principal climbing plants</i> grown in pots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
are the Maurandyas, the Lophospermums,
the Passion-flowers, the Rhodochiton, the
Eccremocarpus, the Ipomæas, and the Cobæa.
There are, however, several others, all of
which are very handsome. The greater
part of these require a rich light soil to
make them grow rapidly, and to be kept
in small pots to throw them into flower.
The Bignonias or Tecomas should be grown
in equal parts of loam and peat; and this
compost will suit the Polygalas, and other
showy climbers. The Sollyas and Billiardieras
should be grown in peat, and frequently
syringed to keep off the green fly. The
Thunbergias are very liable to be attacked
by the red spider. Many of the shrubby
climbers may be treated as annuals, and
raised from seed every year in January, and
planted out in June; but they do still better
treated as biennials, and sown one year to
flower the next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c12">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="c less sp">CALENDAR OF OPERATIONS.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>January.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap large">January</span> may be called the digging month,
as almost the only gardening operation that
can be performed in it is digging, or rather
trenching the ground; and even this cannot
be done unless the weather be open and the
ground free from frost. Nothing can be
imagined more desolate than the appearance
of the flower-garden in this month. Perhaps
the Christmas rose may be in flower,
and a few lingering blossoms may remain on
the Pyrus or Cydonia japonica; but this is
generally all, except a few red berries that
the birds may have left on the holly or the
pyracantha. January, however, is an excellent
month for the destruction of snails and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
insects. The snails will be found in their
winter quarters, sticking to the trunk of
some ivy-clad tree, or hidden beneath the
coping of some wall. They are quite in a
torpid state and appear dead, but might
soon be revived by bringing them into a
warm room, and sprinkling them with water.
Of course, however, if they are to be destroyed,
it should be without rousing them
from their stupor. The eggs of insects
should also be sought for and destroyed.
Those of the lackey moth will be found on
twigs, fixed firmly round them like bracelets
of small beads. These should be burnt, as
they are too hard to be crushed. The eggs
of the vapourer moth will be found on the
outside of the cocoon, looking like a bag of
spider’s eggs. A very small scale-like insect
will also sometimes be found on the branches
of the rose-trees, which should be carefully
removed. Indeed, as a precautionary measure,
it is well to brush the branches of all
the rose-trees in this month with soft soap
and water, to destroy any eggs that may be
adhering to them. Sometimes trees and
shrubs are planted in January if the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
be favourable, but this it very seldom is, as if
not frosty it is generally very wet.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden the fruit-trees and
shrubs, particularly the gooseberries, should
be carefully examined for eggs of insects;
and the trunk and branches of all suspected
trees and shrubs should be brushed with soft
soap and hot water.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>February.</i></p>

<p>In this month, if the weather be favourable,
the gardeners “dress” their beds; that
is, they dig and rake them, manuring them
if necessary. In the flower-garden the
Californian annuals that had stood the
winter in some waste part of the garden are
now brought forward by spadefuls, and laid
over the beds intended for them. The early
bulbs, such as the snow-drop and the Scotch
crocus begin to appear, and here and there a
splendid cloth of gold glitters among them
in its rich yellow and brown. The winter
aconite and the beautiful hepaticus are now
in full glory; and in short all nature appears
awakening from the sleep of winter. This
is pre-eminently the season for spring planting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
and all the trees and shrubs, and even
herbaceous plants that are to be removed are
put into the ground. The garden rose-trees
and other hardy flowering shrubs are pruned,
care being taken always to cut them in a
slanting direction, and to a bud. When the
rose-bushes have sent up long untidy shoots,
every alternate shoot may be cut down to
within a few inches of the ground. Thus
treated, the shoots that are left will flower,
and those that were cut down will send up
strong and vigorous shoots for flowering the
succeeding year, when the present flowering
stems may be cut in. The bushes will thus
be kept of moderate size, and of a compact
habit of growth, without the flowering being
materially checked. In February the ranunculus
roots are planted that are to flower in
the following May, and a hot-bed is made
for the tender annuals. In short, the business
of the gardener’s year has commenced.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden, if the weather be
open, the gooseberries and currants should be
pruned, and also such of the fruit-trees as
have been left for spring pruning. If the
winter has been very hard, the gooseberries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
and currants are left as long as possible unpruned,
because the birds, when driven to
distress for want of food, very often pick off
the buds, and should the number of buds
have been previously diminished by pruning,
the hopes of the season for a good crop of
fruit are generally destroyed. Radishes and
lettuce should be sown in February, and
spinage; also the first crop of peas and
beans. The strawberry-beds are pruned
and dressed, and the raspberry shoots shortened
and cut in.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>March.</i></p>

<p>This is the sowing month. In the flower-garden
the seeds of hardy annuals are sown
in the open border. Turf is laid down
where wanted, and grass-seeds are sown.
Rose-trees are sometimes planted in this
month, and the climbing kinds are pruned
and trained. The best sorts for training as
pyramids of roses are the Noisette and Boursault
kinds, and some of the hybrid China.
The box edgings are taken up and replanted,
and the gravel walks are raked or turned
over, and new gravel added if requisite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
This is in fact the first month that displays
the cheerfulness and brilliancy of spring, for
the flower-garden is gay with crocuses, and
the bees are buzzing about them, while the
birds are singing on every tree. The weather
is often very fine and warm in March;
but there are frequently frosty nights, during
which the tree-peonies and other half-hardy
early-flowering shrubs should be protected
by a kind of beehive-like covering, made
sufficiently large to put on and take off without
injuring the plants. In the country,
these coverings may be made of platted
rushes sewed together, and the gathering
and platting them will afford employment to
poor old women and children in winter.
Biennials, such as hollyhocks, Brompton
stocks, &amp;c., are generally transplanted in this
month.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden the principal crops
of all the culinary vegetables are sown, and
potatoe sets are planted. The spring pruning
and planting are also finished. Forest-trees
are planted in the parks and pleasure-grounds,
and trees are cut down. In short,
in large places March and April probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
form the most laborious period of the gardener’s
year.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>April.</i></p>

<p>In the first week of this month many
gardeners transplant their biennials, instead
of putting them into the ground in March.
The hollyhocks should have a hole dug for
each plant two feet deep, at the bottom of
which should be thrown three or four spadefuls
of strong stable manure. Many gardeners
also plant their dahlia-roots in this
month, though others delay this operation
till May, or even June. However this may
be, the tubers of the dwarf kinds should be
planted at about three feet apart, but the
larger sorts should be four feet or five feet
from each other every way. The soil should
be in a sandy loam, not too rich, lest the
plants should produce more leaves than
flowers, and not too poor, lest the flowers
should be poor also. In planting the tubers,
care should be taken to arrange them in
such a manner that the colours of the flowers
they produce shall have a harmonious effect.
In this month the auriculases generally begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
to come into flower in pots, and the polyanthuses
and primroses in the open ground.
Tuberoses, the different kinds of gladiolus,
the Guernsey lily, and other shewy autumn-flowering
bulbs may be planted towards the
end of April, or the first week in May. A
bed should be prepared for their reception,
by digging the ground about a foot deep,
and taking out about half the soil, which is
to be replaced by equal parts of vegetable-mould
and well-rotted dung. When this is
well dug over and mixed, drills should be
drawn in it, about three or four inches deep
and eighteen inches apart, in which the
bulbs (after first taking off their offsets) are
to be placed about nine inches apart. The
bulbs should be made quite firm in the soil,
and then covered with mould an inch or an
inch and a half deep. They will not require
any water till a week or ten days after
planting, when the roots have begun to grow,
but after that they should be watered regularly.
Heartseases for autumn flowering
may be sown this month, or cuttings may be
made of favourite kinds. The heartsease
requires a shady situation, and a rich loamy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
soil, plentifully supplied with water. The
box edgings may be pruned in this month,
but they should never be clipped. A garden-line
should be stretched along the edging, at
the proper height, generally about four inches
from the ground, above which the highest
point of the box should not reach; and the
box should be cut down to this line, every
shoot being cut in a slanting direction to a
bud, and only every alternate shoot suffered to
reach the line. Hardy annuals also may be
sown in this month, if the sowing of them
was neglected in March. The ornamental
kinds of Ribes and Berberis will begin to
come into flower with Magnolia conspicua,
and the common almond.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden, April may be
called the grafting month, though many
gardeners begin to perform that operation in
March. In the culinary department, those
vegetables that require transplanting, such
as celery, sea-kale, cauliflower, &amp;c., are generally
planted out in April. The peas and
beans are hoed up, as are the potatoes; the
asparagus and artichoke beds are dressed;
and the onions, turnips, &amp;c., are thinned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
If potatoes for the main crop were not
planted in March, they should be now.
The peas should be staked when they are
hoed up; and this is the best season for
dividing roots of thyme and other aromatic
herbs.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>May.</i></p>

<p>In the flower-garden, this is the month
for planting out the tender annuals which
have been raised on a hotbed. The seeds of
hardy annuals may still be sown, and also
those of biennials for planting out the following
spring. In this month, ornamental
perennial plants may be propagated by slips
and cuttings; and if any were made in
April for striking in a hotbed, they may
be transplanted. The leaves of the rose-trees
should be examined for a little brown
grub, which infests them at this season, and
which should be picked off and destroyed.
The flower-garden will now be in all its
splendour. The hyacinths will be in full
bloom, as will also the different kinds of
Ribes, Berberis, and Mahonia, among the
shrubs; and several kinds of Magnolia, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
Judas tree, Edwardsia, &amp;c., among the trees.
The Pæonia Moutan will likewise expand
its magnificent blossoms; and the spring
heartsease will be coming into flower, as will
the Nemophilla insignis, and several of the
other Californian annuals.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden, the operations
continue nearly the same as the last month.
Peas and beans may be sown for the late
crops, and spinach, &amp;c. This is the proper
season for sowing kidney-beans. If the
first crop of peas has not been staked, it
should now be done, and the tops should be
taken off the common beans; both may also
be hoed up. The blossoms of the fruit-trees
should be examined, and those attacked by
insects should be instantly removed, and the
insects they contain destroyed. All leaves
that are found rolled up should be taken off,
and destroyed. In the park and pleasure-grounds,
oak-trees are generally felled in
May, because the movement of the sap at
this season makes the bark separate more
easily from the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span></p>


<p class="c large"><i>June.</i></p>

<p>In the flower-garden, this is the month for
piping and layering pinks and carnations,
and for making cuttings of the tenderer kinds
of roses. The hardy roses will be probably
much infested with the green fly, or aphis,
which should be destroyed with tobacco-water.
Great care should, however, be taken
in using it, or the tobacco-water will disfigure
the plants more than even the aphis
itself. Half-a-pound of the best shag tobacco
should be put into a gallon of hot water, and
the decoction suffered to stand till it is quite
cold. The infested shoots should then be
dipped in the tobacco-water, and suffered to
remain in it about a minute, and then immediately
washed in clean water. Two persons
should perform this operation, one carrying
a saucer with the tobacco-water, and the
other a jug of clean water and a saucer, to
wash the shoots immediately.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden, there is very little
to do, except to sow what are called succession
crops of culinary vegetables, and to
continue the operations of the last month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
where necessary. June is, indeed, rather a
month of enjoyment in a garden, than one
of labour. The fruit-trees, however, may
be pruned or disbudded of their summer
shoots; and towards the end of the month,
budding commences.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>July.</i></p>

<p>The bulbs of hyacinths and tulips are
generally taken up in this month, and put in
to a proper place to dry; as are the tubers of
ranunculuses and anemones. The stalks of
those herbaceous plants that have done flowering
should be cut down, that they may send
up fresh shoots, and produce a second set of
flowers. The dead roses, &amp;c., should be cut
away as soon as they fade, as nothing more
completely destroys the beauty of a flower-garden
than a number of dead flowers mingled
with the newly-expanded ones. Cuttings of
verbenas, and other greenhouse, or window
plants may be made this month; and those
that were made early in spring, may be
planted in the beds to supply the place of
the bulbs, and other plants that have quite
done flowering. Roses, pinks, and carnations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
are in their greatest splendour in June
and July. Roses are generally budded in
this month; though, if the weather be moist,
any time will do from June to September.
The essential point is to have the weather
sufficiently moist and warm to stimulate the
dormant action of the bud.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden the shallots should
be taken up; but in other respects there is
nothing particular to do—except the routine
culture of keeping the garden neat, and sowing
the seeds of culinary vegetables for
succession.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>August.</i></p>

<p>The box edgings are again pruned in this
month as they were in spring. The pinks and
carnations having now done flowering, should
have the layers which were made in June
cut away if they have rooted; and some
German stocks, and other plants which have
been purposely raised in pots, should be
planted amongst the carnations, to prevent
the beds from looking bare of flowers.</p>

<p>The seeds of most of the annual flowers
are now ripe, and should be gathered. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
evergreens and other plants in the shrubberies
should be pruned, and their summer shoots
cut in, if they have been too luxuriant. The
bulbs of crown imperials, lilies, and all the
scaly kinds, which generally remain several
years in the ground without taking them up,
should be planted in this month. They will
grow under the shade of trees, and in any
situation not too dry. If too much exposed
to the sun, the flowers will fade almost as
soon as they expand. Scaly bulbs that have
been long planted, may also be taken up,
their offsets taken off, and the bulb removed
to a new situation; but no scaly bulb should
be kept long out of the ground.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden this is the gathering
month, as most of the fruits and vegetables
are now ripe.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>September.</i></p>

<p>The dahlias are now the principal ornament
of the flower garden; and they should
be kept neatly tied up, and all the dead
flowers removed as soon as they fade. The
autumn flowering bulbs are now in full blossom;
and all the greenhouse and frame plants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
that were turned out are also in flower. The
beds for hyacinths and other spring bulbs
should be dug over and manured.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden, spinach may be
sown for use in spring; and the potatoes and
other roots should be taken up. This is
considered the best month for planting strawberries.
The wall-fruit will require protection
from birds, wasps, and flies. Some
worsted twined backwards and forwards from
projecting nails, is said to be the best protection
from birds; and bottles of sugar and
water hung from the twigs will attract the
wasps and flies from the fruit. After the
fruit of the wall-trees is gathered, the borders
are usually lightly forked over, and what is
called a top-dressing of fresh compost is
spread over them.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>October.</i></p>

<p>In the flower-garden the tender greenhouse
plants should be taken up. Seeds of
the hardy annuals that will stand the winter
should be sown, particularly those of the
heartsease, rocket-larkspur, coreopsis, Eschscholtzia,
and all the californian annuals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
The best way of managing these is to choose
a portion of hard ground on which a little
light earth, six or eight inches deep, has
been laid; in this the seeds should be sown,
and the young plants will be ready to remove
by spadefuls to the beds prepared for them
in spring.</p>

<p>This is the best season for planting hyacinths,
tulips, crocuses, and other bulbs and
corms, and the different varieties of Anemone
hortensis; taking care when planting the
latter to keep the eye of the tuber uppermost.
All the kinds of Pæonies, as well the Pæonia
Moutan as the herbaceous species, should be
planted in this month. The leaves that fall
in great abundance in October and November
should be regularly swept up, and carried
to a rotting heap, that they may decay, and
make the earth so valuable to florists, which
is generally called vegetable mould.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden the remaining fruit
should be gathered. Towards the end of the
month some fruit-trees may be planted if
their leaves have dropped; and the autumnal
pruning may begin, unless the trees should
be still in a growing state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span></p>


<p class="c large"><i>November.</i></p>

<p>In the beginning of this month the appearance
of the flower-garden is extremely
desolate. The dahlias have generally been
seriously injured by the frost, but not quite
so much so as to warrant their removal; and
a few lingering flowers of other kinds recal
melancholy ideas of what has been, but is
passed. A mild November is indeed the old
age of the floral year; and a sharp frost that
kills all the remaining flowers is felt positively
as a relief. The tubers of the dahlias should
be taken up as soon as the frost has changed
their flowers. The names should be attached
to the roots by string, or the Chester metallic
wire; and they should be laid on dry boards
in a cellar, and covered with sand, or in
some dry place, not too warm, in a green-house.
The temperature at which they
should be kept, should be between 35° and
45°. The autumn-flowering bulbs should be
taken up in the same manner, and kept in
dry sand or moss. All the plants that require
protection, should be carefully covered
or matted up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden the beds should be
cleared of all haulm, &amp;c., and dug over and
dressed; and the trees which were not before
planted should be put into the ground.</p>


<p class="c large"><i>December.</i></p>

<p>This month is a perfect blank both for
the flower and the fruit garden; except for
collecting soils, making composts, preparing
labels for names or numbers, sticks or stakes
for tying up plants, nails and list for fastening
them; and in mild weather, for pruning the
larger and more hardy deciduous trees and
shrubs, &amp;c.</p>
